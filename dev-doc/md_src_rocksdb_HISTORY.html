<li>Fix builds for some platforms.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md369"></a>
6.26.0 (2021-10-20)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md370"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixes a bug in directed IO mode when calling MultiGet() for blobs in the same blob file. The bug is caused by not sorting the blob read requests by file offsets.</li>
<li>Fix the incorrect disabling of SST rate limited deletion when the WAL and DB are in different directories. Only WAL rate limited deletion should be disabled if its in a different directory.</li>
<li>Fix <code>DisableManualCompaction()</code> to cancel compactions even when they are waiting on automatic compactions to drain due to <code>CompactRangeOptions::exclusive_manual_compactions == true</code>.</li>
<li>Fix contract of <code>Env::ReopenWritableFile()</code> and <code>FileSystem::ReopenWritableFile()</code> to specify any existing file must not be deleted or truncated.</li>
<li>Fixed bug in calls to <code>IngestExternalFiles()</code> with files for multiple column families. The bug could have introduced a delay in ingested file keys becoming visible after <code>IngestExternalFiles()</code> returned. Furthermore, mutations to ingested file keys while they were invisible could have been dropped (not necessarily immediately).</li>
<li>Fixed a possible race condition impacting users of <code>WriteBufferManager</code> who constructed it with <code>allow_stall == true</code>. The race condition led to undefined behavior (in our experience, typically a process crash).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where stalled writes would remain stalled forever after the user calls <code>WriteBufferManager::SetBufferSize()</code> with <code>new_size == 0</code> to dynamically disable memory limiting.</li>
<li>Make <code>DB::close()</code> thread-safe.</li>
<li>Fix a bug in atomic flush where one bg flush thread will wait forever for a preceding bg flush thread to commit its result to MANIFEST but encounters an error which is mapped to a soft error (DB not stopped).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md371"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Print information about blob files when using "ldb list_live_files_metadata"</li>
<li>Provided support for SingleDelete with user defined timestamp.</li>
<li>Experimental new function DB::GetLiveFilesStorageInfo offers essentially a unified version of other functions like GetLiveFiles, GetLiveFilesChecksumInfo, and GetSortedWalFiles. Checkpoints and backups could show small behavioral changes and/or improved performance as they now use this new API.</li>
<li>Add remote compaction read/write bytes statistics: <code>REMOTE_COMPACT_READ_BYTES</code>, <code>REMOTE_COMPACT_WRITE_BYTES</code>.</li>
<li>Introduce an experimental feature to dump out the blocks from block cache and insert them to the secondary cache to reduce the cache warmup time (e.g., used while migrating DB instance). More information are in <code>class CacheDumper</code> and <code>CacheDumpedLoader</code> at <code><a class="el" href="cache__dump__load_8h_source.html">rocksdb/utilities/cache_dump_load.h</a></code> Note that, this feature is subject to the potential change in the future, it is still experimental.</li>
<li>Introduced a new BlobDB configuration option <code>blob_garbage_collection_force_threshold</code>, which can be used to trigger compactions targeting the SST files which reference the oldest blob files when the ratio of garbage in those blob files meets or exceeds the specified threshold. This can reduce space amplification with skewed workloads where the affected SST files might not otherwise get picked up for compaction.</li>
<li>Added EXPERIMENTAL support for table file (SST) unique identifiers that are stable and universally unique, available with new function <code>GetUniqueIdFromTableProperties</code>. Only SST files from RocksDB &gt;= 6.24 support unique IDs.</li>
<li>Added <code>GetMapProperty()</code> support for "rocksdb.dbstats" (<code>DB::Properties::kDBStats</code>). As a map property, it includes DB-level internal stats accumulated over the DB's lifetime, such as user write related stats and uptime.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md372"></a>
Public API change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Made SystemClock extend the Customizable class and added a CreateFromString method. Implementations need to be registered with the ObjectRegistry and to implement a Name() method in order to be created via this method.</li>
<li>Made SliceTransform extend the Customizable class and added a CreateFromString method. Implementations need to be registered with the ObjectRegistry and to implement a Name() method in order to be created via this method. The Capped and Prefixed transform classes return a short name (no length); use GetId for the fully qualified name.</li>
<li>Made FileChecksumGenFactory, SstPartitionerFactory, TablePropertiesCollectorFactory, and WalFilter extend the Customizable class and added a CreateFromString method.</li>
<li>Some fields of SstFileMetaData are deprecated for compatibility with new base class FileStorageInfo.</li>
<li>Add <code>file_temperature</code> to <code>IngestExternalFileArg</code> such that when ingesting SST files, we are able to indicate the temperature of the this batch of files.</li>
<li>If <code>DB::Close()</code> failed with a non aborted status, calling <code>DB::Close()</code> again will return the original status instead of Status::OK.</li>
<li>Add CacheTier to <a class="el" href="advanced__options_8h_source.html">advanced_options.h</a> to describe the cache tier we used. Add a <code>lowest_used_cache_tier</code> option to <code>DBOptions</code> (immutable) and pass it to BlockBasedTableReader. By default it is <code>CacheTier::kNonVolatileBlockTier</code>, which means, we always use both block cache (kVolatileTier) and secondary cache (kNonVolatileBlockTier). By set it to <code>CacheTier::kVolatileTier</code>, the DB will not use the secondary cache.</li>
<li>Even when options.max_compaction_bytes is hit, compaction output files are only cut when it aligns with grandparent files' boundaries. options.max_compaction_bytes could be slightly violated with the change, but the violation is no more than one target SST file size, which is usually much smaller.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md373"></a>
Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improved CPU efficiency of building block-based table (SST) files (#9039 and #9040).</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md374"></a>
Java API Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add Java API bindings for new integrated BlobDB options</li>
<li><code>keyMayExist()</code> supports ByteBuffer.</li>
<li>Fix multiget throwing Null Pointer Exception for num of keys &gt; 70k (<a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/8039">https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/8039</a>).</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md375"></a>
6.25.0 (2021-09-20)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md376"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Allow secondary instance to refresh iterator. Assign read seq after referencing SuperVersion.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug of secondary instance's last_sequence going backward, and reads on the secondary fail to see recent updates from the primary.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that could lead to duplicate DB ID or DB session ID in POSIX environments without /proc/sys/kernel/random/uuid.</li>
<li>Fix a race in DumpStats() with column family destruction due to not taking a Ref on each entry while iterating the ColumnFamilySet.</li>
<li>Fix a race in item ref counting in LRUCache when promoting an item from the SecondaryCache.</li>
<li>Fix a race in BackupEngine if RateLimiter is reconfigured during concurrent Restore operations.</li>
<li>Fix a bug on POSIX in which failure to create a lock file (e.g. out of space) can prevent future LockFile attempts in the same process on the same file from succeeding.</li>
<li>Fix a bug that backup_rate_limiter and restore_rate_limiter in BackupEngine could not limit read rates.</li>
<li>Fix the implementation of <code>prepopulate_block_cache = kFlushOnly</code> to only apply to flushes rather than to all generated files.</li>
<li>Fix WAL log data corruption when using DBOptions.manual_wal_flush(true) and WriteOptions.sync(true) together. The sync WAL should work with locked log_write_mutex_.</li>
<li>Add checks for validity of the IO uring completion queue entries, and fail the BlockBasedTableReader MultiGet sub-batch if there's an invalid completion</li>
<li>Add an interface RocksDbIOUringEnable() that, if defined by the user, will allow them to enable/disable the use of IO uring by RocksDB</li>
<li>Fix the bug that when direct I/O is used and MultiRead() returns a short result, RandomAccessFileReader::MultiRead() still returns full size buffer, with returned short value together with some data in original buffer. This bug is unlikely cause incorrect results, because (1) since FileSystem layer is expected to retry on short result, returning short results is only possible when asking more bytes in the end of the file, which RocksDB doesn't do when using MultiRead(); (2) checksum is unlikely to match.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md377"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>RemoteCompaction's interface now includes <code>db_name</code>, <code>db_id</code>, <code>session_id</code>, which could help the user uniquely identify compaction job between db instances and sessions.</li>
<li>Added a ticker statistic, "rocksdb.verify_checksum.read.bytes", reporting how many bytes were read from file to serve <code>VerifyChecksum()</code> and <code>VerifyFileChecksums()</code> queries.</li>
<li>Added ticker statistics, "rocksdb.backup.read.bytes" and "rocksdb.backup.write.bytes", reporting how many bytes were read and written during backup.</li>
<li>Added properties for BlobDB: <code>rocksdb.num-blob-files</code>, <code>rocksdb.blob-stats</code>, <code>rocksdb.total-blob-file-size</code>, and <code>rocksdb.live-blob-file-size</code>. The existing property <code>rocksdb.estimate_live-data-size</code> was also extended to include live bytes residing in blob files.</li>
<li>Added two new RateLimiter IOPriorities: <code>Env::IO_USER</code>,<code>Env::IO_MID</code>. <code>Env::IO_USER</code> will have superior priority over all other RateLimiter IOPriorities without being subject to fair scheduling constraint.</li>
<li><code>SstFileWriter</code> now supports <code>Put</code>s and <code>Delete</code>s with user-defined timestamps. Note that the ingestion logic itself is not timestamp-aware yet.</li>
<li>Allow a single write batch to include keys from multiple column families whose timestamps' formats can differ. For example, some column families may disable timestamp, while others enable timestamp.</li>
<li>Add compaction priority information in RemoteCompaction, which can be used to schedule high priority job first.</li>
<li>Added new callback APIs <code>OnBlobFileCreationStarted</code>,<code>OnBlobFileCreated</code>and <code>OnBlobFileDeleted</code> in <code>EventListener</code> class of <a class="el" href="listener_8h_source.html">listener.h</a>. It notifies listeners during creation/deletion of individual blob files in Integrated BlobDB. It also log blob file creation finished event and deletion event in LOG file.</li>
<li>Batch blob read requests for <code>DB::MultiGet</code> using <code>MultiRead</code>.</li>
<li>Add support for fallback to local compaction, the user can return <code>CompactionServiceJobStatus::kUseLocal</code> to instruct RocksDB to run the compaction locally instead of waiting for the remote compaction result.</li>
<li>Add built-in rate limiter's implementation of <code>RateLimiter::GetTotalPendingRequest(int64_t* total_pending_requests, const Env::IOPriority pri)</code> for the total number of requests that are pending for bytes in the rate limiter.</li>
<li>Charge memory usage during data buffering, from which training samples are gathered for dictionary compression, to block cache. Unbuffering data can now be triggered if the block cache becomes full and <code>strict_capacity_limit=true</code> for the block cache, in addition to existing conditions that can trigger unbuffering.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md378"></a>
Public API change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remove obsolete implementation details FullKey and ParseFullKey from public API</li>
<li>Change <code>SstFileMetaData::size</code> from <code>size_t</code> to <code>uint64_t</code>.</li>
<li>Made Statistics extend the Customizable class and added a CreateFromString method. Implementations of Statistics need to be registered with the ObjectRegistry and to implement a Name() method in order to be created via this method.</li>
<li>Extended <code>FlushJobInfo</code> and <code>CompactionJobInfo</code> in <a class="el" href="listener_8h_source.html">listener.h</a> to provide information about the blob files generated by a flush/compaction and garbage collected during compaction in Integrated BlobDB. Added struct members <code>blob_file_addition_infos</code> and <code>blob_file_garbage_infos</code> that contain this information.</li>
<li>Extended parameter <code>output_file_names</code> of <code>CompactFiles</code> API to also include paths of the blob files generated by the compaction in Integrated BlobDB.</li>
<li>Most <code>BackupEngine</code> functions now return <code>IOStatus</code> instead of <code>Status</code>. Most existing code should be compatible with this change but some calls might need to be updated.</li>
<li>Add a new field <code>level_at_creation</code> in <code>TablePropertiesCollectorFactory::Context</code> to capture the level at creating the SST file (i.e, table), of which the properties are being collected.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md379"></a>
Miscellaneous</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a paranoid check where in case FileSystem layer doesn't fill the buffer but returns succeed, checksum is unlikely to match even if buffer contains a previous block. The byte modified is not useful anyway, so it isn't expected to change any behavior when FileSystem is satisfying its contract.</li>
</ul>

6.24.0 (2021-08-20)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md381"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If the primary's CURRENT file is missing or inaccessible, the secondary instance should not hang repeatedly trying to switch to a new MANIFEST. It should instead return the error code encountered while accessing the file.</li>
<li>Restoring backups with BackupEngine is now a logically atomic operation, so that if a restore operation is interrupted, DB::Open on it will fail. Using BackupEngineOptions::sync (default) ensures atomicity even in case of power loss or OS crash.</li>
<li>Fixed a race related to the destruction of <code>ColumnFamilyData</code> objects. The earlier logic unlocked the DB mutex before destroying the thread-local <code>SuperVersion</code> pointers, which could result in a process crash if another thread managed to get a reference to the <code>ColumnFamilyData</code> object.</li>
<li>Removed a call to <code>RenameFile()</code> on a non-existent info log file ("LOG") when opening a new DB. Such a call was guaranteed to fail though did not impact applications since we swallowed the error. Now we also stopped swallowing errors in renaming "LOG" file.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where <code>OnFlushCompleted</code> was not called for atomic flush.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug affecting the batched <code>MultiGet</code> API when used with keys spanning multiple column families and <code>sorted_input == false</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential incorrect result in opt mode and assertion failures caused by releasing snapshot(s) during compaction.</li>
<li>Fixed passing of BlobFileCompletionCallback to Compaction job and Atomic flush job which was default paramter (nullptr). BlobFileCompletitionCallback is internal callback that manages addition of blob files to SSTFileManager.</li>
<li>Fixed MultiGet not updating the block_read_count and block_read_byte PerfContext counters.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md382"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Made the EventListener extend the Customizable class.</li>
<li>EventListeners that have a non-empty Name() and that are registered with the ObjectRegistry can now be serialized to/from the OPTIONS file.</li>
<li>Insert warm blocks (data blocks, uncompressed dict blocks, index and filter blocks) in Block cache during flush under option BlockBasedTableOptions.prepopulate_block_cache. Previously it was enabled for only data blocks.</li>
<li>BlockBasedTableOptions.prepopulate_block_cache can be dynamically configured using DB::SetOptions.</li>
<li>Add CompactionOptionsFIFO.age_for_warm, which allows RocksDB to move old files to warm tier in FIFO compactions. Note that file temperature is still an experimental feature.</li>
<li>Add a comment to suggest btrfs user to disable file preallocation by setting <code>options.allow_fallocate=false</code>.</li>
<li>Fast forward option in Trace replay changed to double type to allow replaying at a lower speed, by settings the value between 0 and 1. This option can be set via <code>ReplayOptions</code> in <code>Replayer::Replay()</code>, or via <code>--trace_replay_fast_forward</code> in db_bench.</li>
<li>Add property <code>LiveSstFilesSizeAtTemperature</code> to retrieve sst file size at different temperature.</li>
<li>Added a stat rocksdb.secondary.cache.hits.</li>
<li>Added a PerfContext counter secondary_cache_hit_count.</li>
<li>The integrated BlobDB implementation now supports the tickers <code>BLOB_DB_BLOB_FILE_BYTES_READ</code>, <code>BLOB_DB_GC_NUM_KEYS_RELOCATED</code>, and <code>BLOB_DB_GC_BYTES_RELOCATED</code>, as well as the histograms <code>BLOB_DB_COMPRESSION_MICROS</code> and <code>BLOB_DB_DECOMPRESSION_MICROS</code>.</li>
<li>Added hybrid configuration of Ribbon filter and Bloom filter where some LSM levels use Ribbon for memory space efficiency and some use Bloom for speed. See NewRibbonFilterPolicy. This also changes the default behavior of NewRibbonFilterPolicy to use Bloom for flushes under Leveled and Universal compaction and Ribbon otherwise. The C API function <code>rocksdb_filterpolicy_create_ribbon</code> is unchanged but adds new <code>rocksdb_filterpolicy_create_ribbon_hybrid</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md383"></a>
Public API change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added APIs to decode and replay trace file via Replayer class. Added <code>DB::NewDefaultReplayer()</code> to create a default Replayer instance. Added <code>TraceReader::Reset()</code> to restart reading a trace file. Created <a class="el" href="trace__record_8h_source.html">trace_record.h</a>, <a class="el" href="trace__record__result_8h_source.html">trace_record_result.h</a> and <a class="el" href="replayer_8h_source.html">utilities/replayer.h</a> files to access the decoded Trace records, replay them, and query the actual operation results.</li>
<li>Added Configurable::GetOptionsMap to the public API for use in creating new Customizable classes.</li>
<li>Generalized bits_per_key parameters in C API from int to double for greater configurability. Although this is a compatible change for existing C source code, anything depending on C API signatures, such as foreign function interfaces, will need to be updated.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md384"></a>
Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Try to avoid updating DBOptions if <code>SetDBOptions()</code> does not change any option value.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md385"></a>
Behavior Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>StringAppendOperator</code> additionally accepts a string as the delimiter.</li>
<li>BackupEngineOptions::sync (default true) now applies to restoring backups in addition to creating backups. This could slow down restores, but ensures they are fully persisted before returning OK. (Consider increasing max_background_operations to improve performance.)</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md386"></a>
6.23.0 (2021-07-16)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md387"></a>
Behavior Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Obsolete keys in the bottommost level that were preserved for a snapshot will now be cleaned upon snapshot release in all cases. This form of compaction (snapshot release triggered compaction) previously had an artificial limitation that multiple tombstones needed to be present. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md388"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Blob file checksums are now printed in hexadecimal format when using the <code>manifest_dump</code> <code>ldb</code> command.</li>
<li><code>GetLiveFilesMetaData()</code> now populates the <code>temperature</code>, <code>oldest_ancester_time</code>, and <code>file_creation_time</code> fields of its <code>LiveFileMetaData</code> results when the information is available. Previously these fields always contained zero indicating unknown.</li>
<li>Fix mismatches of OnCompaction{Begin,Completed} in case of DisableManualCompaction().</li>
<li>Fix continuous logging of an existing background error on every user write</li>
<li>Fix a bug that <code>Get()</code> return Status::OK() and an empty value for non-existent key when <code>read_options.read_tier = kBlockCacheTier</code>.</li>
<li>Fix a bug that stat in <code>get_context</code> didn't accumulate to statistics when query is failed.</li>
<li>Fixed handling of DBOptions::wal_dir with LoadLatestOptions() or ldb &ndash;try_load_options on a copied or moved DB. Previously, when the WAL directory is same as DB directory (default), a copied or moved DB would reference the old path of the DB as the WAL directory, potentially corrupting both copies. Under this change, the wal_dir from DB::GetOptions() or LoadLatestOptions() may now be empty, indicating that the current DB directory is used for WALs. This is also a subtle API change.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md389"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>ldb has a new feature, <code>list_live_files_metadata</code>, that shows the live SST files, as well as their LSM storage level and the column family they belong to.</li>
<li>The new BlobDB implementation now tracks the amount of garbage in each blob file in the MANIFEST.</li>
<li>Integrated BlobDB now supports Merge with base values (Put/Delete etc.).</li>
<li>RemoteCompaction supports sub-compaction, the job_id in the user interface is changed from <code>int</code> to <code>uint64_t</code> to support sub-compaction id.</li>
<li>Expose statistics option in RemoteCompaction worker.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md390"></a>
Public API change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added APIs to the Customizable class to allow developers to create their own Customizable classes. Created the <a class="el" href="customizable__util_8h_source.html">utilities/customizable_util.h</a> file to contain helper methods for developing new Customizable classes.</li>
<li>Change signature of SecondaryCache::Name(). Make SecondaryCache customizable and add SecondaryCache::CreateFromString method.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md391"></a>
6.22.0 (2021-06-18)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md392"></a>
Behavior Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added two additional tickers, MEMTABLE_PAYLOAD_BYTES_AT_FLUSH and MEMTABLE_GARBAGE_BYTES_AT_FLUSH. These stats can be used to estimate the ratio of "garbage" (outdated) bytes in the memtable that are discarded at flush time.</li>
<li>Added API comments clarifying safe usage of Disable/EnableManualCompaction and EventListener callbacks for compaction. </li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md393"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>fs_posix.cc GetFreeSpace() always report disk space available to root even when running as non-root. Linux defaults often have disk mounts with 5 to 10 percent of total space reserved only for root. Out of space could result for non-root users.</li>
<li>Subcompactions are now disabled when user-defined timestamps are used, since the subcompaction boundary picking logic is currently not timestamp-aware, which could lead to incorrect results when different subcompactions process keys that only differ by timestamp.</li>
<li>Fix an issue that <code>DeleteFilesInRange()</code> may cause ongoing compaction reports corruption exception, or ASSERT for debug build. There's no actual data loss or corruption that we find.</li>
<li>Fixed confusingly duplicated output in LOG for periodic stats ("DUMPING STATS"), including "Compaction Stats" and "File Read Latency Histogram By Level".</li>
<li>Fixed performance bugs in background gathering of block cache entry statistics, that could consume a lot of CPU when there are many column families with a shared block cache.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md394"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Marked the Ribbon filter and optimize_filters_for_memory features as production-ready, each enabling memory savings for Bloom-like filters. Use <code>NewRibbonFilterPolicy</code> in place of <code>NewBloomFilterPolicy</code> to use Ribbon filters instead of Bloom, or <code>ribbonfilter</code> in place of <code>bloomfilter</code> in configuration string.</li>
<li>Allow <code>DBWithTTL</code> to use <code>DeleteRange</code> api just like other DBs. <code>DeleteRangeCF()</code> which executes <code>WriteBatchInternal::DeleteRange()</code> has been added to the handler in <code>DBWithTTLImpl::Write()</code> to implement it.</li>
<li>Add BlockBasedTableOptions.prepopulate_block_cache. If enabled, it prepopulate warm/hot data blocks which are already in memory into block cache at the time of flush. On a flush, the data block that is in memory (in memtables) get flushed to the device. If using Direct IO, additional IO is incurred to read this data back into memory again, which is avoided by enabling this option and it also helps with Distributed FileSystem. More details in <a class="el" href="table_8h_source.html">include/rocksdb/table.h</a>.</li>
<li>Added a <code>cancel</code> field to <code>CompactRangeOptions</code>, allowing individual in-process manual range compactions to be cancelled.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md395"></a>

6.21.0 (2021-05-21)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md398"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug in handling file rename error in distributed/network file systems when the server succeeds but client returns error. The bug can cause CURRENT file to point to non-existing MANIFEST file, thus DB cannot be opened.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where ingested files were written with incorrect boundary key metadata. In rare cases this could have led to a level's files being wrongly ordered and queries for the boundary keys returning wrong results.</li>
<li>Fixed a data race between insertion into memtables and the retrieval of the DB properties <code>rocksdb.cur-size-active-mem-table</code>, <code>rocksdb.cur-size-all-mem-tables</code>, and <code>rocksdb.size-all-mem-tables</code>.</li>
<li>Fixed the false-positive alert when recovering from the WAL file. Avoid reporting "SST file is ahead of WAL" on a newly created empty column family, if the previous WAL file is corrupted.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where <code>GetLiveFiles()</code> output included a non-existent file called "OPTIONS-000000". Backups and checkpoints, which use <code>GetLiveFiles()</code>, failed on DBs impacted by this bug. Read-write DBs were impacted when the latest OPTIONS file failed to write and <code>fail_if_options_file_error == false</code>. Read-only DBs were impacted when no OPTIONS files existed.</li>
<li>Handle return code by io_uring_submit_and_wait() and io_uring_wait_cqe().</li>
<li>In the IngestExternalFile() API, only try to sync the ingested file if the file is linked and the FileSystem/Env supports reopening a writable file.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that <code>AdvancedColumnFamilyOptions.max_compaction_bytes</code> is under-calculated for manual compaction (<code>CompactRange()</code>). Manual compaction is split to multiple compactions if the compaction size exceed the <code>max_compaction_bytes</code>. The bug creates much larger compaction which size exceed the user setting. On the other hand, larger manual compaction size can increase the subcompaction parallelism, you can tune that by setting <code>max_compaction_bytes</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md399"></a>
Behavior Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Due to the fix of false-postive alert of "SST file is ahead of WAL", all the CFs with no SST file (CF empty) will bypass the consistency check. We fixed a false-positive, but introduced a very rare true-negative which will be triggered in the following conditions: A CF with some delete operations in the last a few queries which will result in an empty CF (those are flushed to SST file and a compaction triggered which combines this file and all other SST files and generates an empty CF, or there is another reason to write a manifest entry for this CF after a flush that generates no SST file from an empty CF). The deletion entries are logged in a WAL and this WAL was corrupted, while the CF's log number points to the next WAL (due to the flush). Therefore, the DB can only recover to the point without these trailing deletions and cause the inconsistent DB status.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md400"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add new option allow_stall passed during instance creation of WriteBufferManager. When allow_stall is set, WriteBufferManager will stall all writers shared across multiple DBs and columns if memory usage goes beyond specified WriteBufferManager::buffer_size (soft limit). Stall will be cleared when memory is freed after flush and memory usage goes down below buffer_size.</li>
<li>Allow <code>CompactionFilter</code>s to apply in more table file creation scenarios such as flush and recovery. For compatibility, <code>CompactionFilter</code>s by default apply during compaction. Users can customize this behavior by overriding <code>CompactionFilterFactory::ShouldFilterTableFileCreation()</code>.</li>
<li>Added more fields to FilterBuildingContext with LSM details, for custom filter policies that vary behavior based on where they are in the LSM-tree.</li>
<li>Added DB::Properties::kBlockCacheEntryStats for querying statistics on what percentage of block cache is used by various kinds of blocks, etc. using DB::GetProperty and DB::GetMapProperty. The same information is now dumped to info LOG periodically according to <code>stats_dump_period_sec</code>.</li>
<li>Add an experimental Remote Compaction feature, which allows the user to run Compaction on a different host or process. The feature is still under development, currently only works on some basic use cases. The interface will be changed without backward/forward compatibility support.</li>
<li>RocksDB would validate total entries read in flush, and compare with counter inserted into it. If flush_verify_memtable_count = true (default), flush will fail. Otherwise, only log to info logs.</li>
<li>Add <code>TableProperties::num_filter_entries</code>, which can be used with <code>TableProperties::filter_size</code> to calculate the effective bits per filter entry (unique user key or prefix) for a table file.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md401"></a>
Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>BlockPrefetcher is used by iterators to prefetch data if they anticipate more data to be used in future. It is enabled implicitly by rocksdb. Added change to take in account read pattern if reads are sequential. This would disable prefetching for random reads in MultiGet and iterators as readahead_size is increased exponential doing large prefetches.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md402"></a>
Public API change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Removed a parameter from TableFactory::NewTableBuilder, which should not be called by user code because TableBuilder is not a public API.</li>
<li>Removed unused structure <code>CompactionFilterContext</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>skip_filters</code> parameter to SstFileWriter is now considered deprecated. Use <code>BlockBasedTableOptions::filter_policy</code> to control generation of filters.</li>
<li>ClockCache is known to have bugs that could lead to crash or corruption, so should not be used until fixed. Use NewLRUCache instead.</li>
<li>Added a new pure virtual function <code>ApplyToAllEntries</code> to <code>Cache</code>, to replace <code>ApplyToAllCacheEntries</code>. Custom <code>Cache</code> implementations must add an implementation. Because this function is for gathering statistics, an empty implementation could be acceptable for some applications.</li>
<li>Added the ObjectRegistry to the ConfigOptions class. This registry instance will be used to find any customizable loadable objects during initialization.</li>
<li>Expanded the ObjectRegistry functionality to allow nested ObjectRegistry instances. Added methods to register a set of functions with the registry/library as a group.</li>
<li>Deprecated <a class="el" href="backupable__db_8h_source.html">backupable_db.h</a> and BackupableDBOptions in favor of new versions with appropriate names: <a class="el" href="backup__engine_8h_source.html">backup_engine.h</a> and BackupEngineOptions. Old API compatibility is preserved.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md403"></a>
Default Option Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>When options.arena_block_size &lt;= 0 (default value 0), still use writer_buffer_size / 8 but cap to 1MB. Too large alloation size might not be friendly to allocator and might cause performance issues in extreme cases.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md404"></a>
Build</h2>
<ul>
<li>By default, try to build with liburing. For make, if ROCKSDB_USE_IO_URING is not set, treat as enable, which means RocksDB will try to build with liburing. Users can disable it with ROCKSDB_USE_IO_URING=0. For cmake, add WITH_LIBURING to control it, with default on.</li>

6.20.0 (2021-04-16)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md406"></a>
Behavior Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>ColumnFamilyOptions::sample_for_compression</code> now takes effect for creation of all block-based tables. Previously it only took effect for block-based tables created by flush.</li>
<li><code>CompactFiles()</code> can no longer compact files from lower level to up level, which has the risk to corrupt DB (details: #8063). The validation is also added to all compactions.</li>
<li>Fixed some cases in which DB::OpenForReadOnly() could write to the filesystem. If you want a <a class="el" href="classLogger.html" title="Class to print logs to either stdout/stderr or the syslog.">Logger</a> with a read-only DB, you must now set DBOptions::info_log yourself, such as using CreateLoggerFromOptions().</li>
<li>get_iostats_context() will never return nullptr. If thread-local support is not available, and user does not opt-out iostats context, then compilation will fail. The same applies to perf context as well.</li>
<li>Added support for WriteBatchWithIndex::NewIteratorWithBase when overwrite_key=false. Previously, this combination was not supported and would assert or return nullptr.</li>
<li>Improve the behavior of WriteBatchWithIndex for Merge operations. Now more operations may be stored in order to return the correct merged result.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md407"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Use thread-safe <code>strerror_r()</code> to get error messages.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential hang in shutdown for a DB whose <code>Env</code> has high-pri thread pool disabled (<code>Env::GetBackgroundThreads(Env::Priority::HIGH) == 0</code>)</li>
<li>Made BackupEngine thread-safe and added documentation comments to clarify what is safe for multiple BackupEngine objects accessing the same backup directory.</li>
<li>Fixed crash (divide by zero) when compression dictionary is applied to a file containing only range tombstones.</li>
<li>Fixed a backward iteration bug with partitioned filter enabled: not including the prefix of the last key of the previous filter partition in current filter partition can cause wrong iteration result.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that allowed <code>DBOptions::max_open_files</code> to be set with a non-negative integer with <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::compaction_style = kCompactionStyleFIFO</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md408"></a>
Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>On ARM platform, use <code>yield</code> instead of <code>wfe</code> to relax cpu to gain better performance.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md409"></a>
Public API change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>TableProperties::slow_compression_estimated_data_size</code> and <code>TableProperties::fast_compression_estimated_data_size</code>. When <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::sample_for_compression &gt; 0</code>, they estimate what <code>TableProperties::data_size</code> would have been if the "fast" or "slow" (see <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::sample_for_compression</code> API doc for definitions) compression had been used instead.</li>
<li>Update DB::StartIOTrace and remove Env object from the arguments as its redundant and DB already has Env object that is passed down to IOTracer::StartIOTrace</li>
<li>Added <code>FlushReason::kWalFull</code>, which is reported when a memtable is flushed due to the WAL reaching its size limit; those flushes were previously reported as <code>FlushReason::kWriteBufferManager</code>. Also, changed the reason for flushes triggered by the write buffer manager to <code>FlushReason::kWriteBufferManager</code>; they were previously reported as <code>FlushReason::kWriteBufferFull</code>.</li>
<li>Extend file_checksum_dump ldb command and DB::GetLiveFilesChecksumInfo API for IntegratedBlobDB and get checksum of blob files along with SST files.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md410"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the ability to open BackupEngine backups as read-only DBs, using BackupInfo::name_for_open and env_for_open provided by BackupEngine::GetBackupInfo() with include_file_details=true.</li>
<li>Added BackupEngine support for integrated BlobDB, with blob files shared between backups when table files are shared. Because of current limitations, blob files always use the kLegacyCrc32cAndFileSize naming scheme, and incremental backups must read and checksum all blob files in a DB, even for files that are already backed up.</li>
<li>Added an optional output parameter to BackupEngine::CreateNewBackup(WithMetadata) to return the BackupID of the new backup.</li>
<li>Added BackupEngine::GetBackupInfo / GetLatestBackupInfo for querying individual backups.</li>
<li>Made the Ribbon filter a long-term supported feature in terms of the SST schema(compatible with version &gt;= 6.15.0) though the API for enabling it is expected to change.</li>
</ul>

6.19.0 (2021-03-21)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md412"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed the truncation error found in APIs/tools when dumping block-based SST files in a human-readable format. After fix, the block-based table can be fully dumped as a readable file.</li>
<li>When hitting a write slowdown condition, no write delay (previously 1 millisecond) is imposed until <code>delayed_write_rate</code> is actually exceeded, with an initial burst allowance of 1 millisecond worth of bytes. Also, beyond the initial burst allowance, <code>delayed_write_rate</code> is now more strictly enforced, especially with multiple column families.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md413"></a>
Public API change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed default <code>BackupableDBOptions::share_files_with_checksum</code> to <code>true</code> and deprecated <code>false</code> because of potential for data loss. Note that accepting this change in behavior can temporarily increase backup data usage because files are not shared between backups using the two different settings. Also removed obsolete option kFlagMatchInterimNaming.</li>
<li>Add a new option BlockBasedTableOptions::max_auto_readahead_size. RocksDB does auto-readahead for iterators on noticing more than two reads for a table file if user doesn't provide readahead_size. The readahead starts at 8KB and doubles on every additional read upto max_auto_readahead_size and now max_auto_readahead_size can be configured dynamically as well. Found that 256 KB readahead size provides the best performance, based on experiments, for auto readahead. Experiment data is in PR #3282. If value is set 0 then no automatic prefetching will be done by rocksdb. Also changing the value will only affect files opened after the change.</li>
<li>Add suppport to extend DB::VerifyFileChecksums API to also verify blob files checksum.</li>
<li>When using the new BlobDB, the amount of data written by flushes/compactions is now broken down into table files and blob files in the compaction statistics; namely, Write(GB) denotes the amount of data written to table files, while Wblob(GB) means the amount of data written to blob files.</li>
<li>New default BlockBasedTableOptions::format_version=5 to enable new Bloom filter implementation by default, compatible with RocksDB versions &gt;= 6.6.0.</li>
<li>Add new SetBufferSize API to WriteBufferManager to allow dynamic management of memory allotted to all write buffers. This allows user code to adjust memory monitoring provided by WriteBufferManager as process memory needs change datasets grow and shrink.</li>
<li>Clarified the required semantics of Read() functions in FileSystem and Env APIs. Please ensure any custom implementations are compliant.</li>
<li>For the new integrated BlobDB implementation, compaction statistics now include the amount of data read from blob files during compaction (due to garbage collection or compaction filters). Write amplification metrics have also been extended to account for data read from blob files.</li>
<li>Add EqualWithoutTimestamp() to Comparator.</li>
<li>Extend support to track blob files in SSTFileManager whenever a blob file is created/deleted. Blob files will be scheduled to delete via SSTFileManager and SStFileManager will now take blob files in account while calculating size and space limits along with SST files.</li>
<li>Add new Append and PositionedAppend API with checksum handoff to legacy Env.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md414"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support compaction filters for the new implementation of BlobDB. Add <code>FilterBlobByKey()</code> to <code>CompactionFilter</code>. Subclasses can override this method so that compaction filters can determine whether the actual blob value has to be read during compaction. Use a new <code>kUndetermined</code> in <code>CompactionFilter::Decision</code> to indicated that further action is necessary for compaction filter to make a decision.</li>
<li>Add support to extend retrieval of checksums for blob files from the MANIFEST when checkpointing. During backup, rocksdb can detect corruption in blob files during file copies.</li>
<li>Add new options for db_bench &ndash;benchmarks: flush, waitforcompaction, compact0, compact1.</li>
<li>Add an option to BackupEngine::GetBackupInfo to include the name and size of each backed-up file. Especially in the presence of file sharing among backups, this offers detailed insight into backup space usage.</li>
<li>Enable backward iteration on keys with user-defined timestamps.</li>
<li>Add statistics and info log for error handler: counters for bg error, bg io error, bg retryable io error, auto resume count, auto resume total retry number, and auto resume sucess; Histogram for auto resume retry count in each recovery call. Note that, each auto resume attempt will have one or multiple retries.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md415"></a>
Behavior Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>During flush, only WAL sync retryable IO error is mapped to hard error, which will stall the writes. When WAL is used but only SST file write has retryable IO error, it will be mapped to soft error and write will not be affected.</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md416"></a>
6.18.0 (2021-02-19)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md417"></a>
Behavior Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>When retryable IO error occurs during compaction, it is mapped to soft error and set the BG error. However, auto resume is not called to clean the soft error since compaction will reschedule by itself. In this change, When retryable IO error occurs during compaction, BG error is not set. User will be informed the error via EventHelper.</li>
<li>Introduce a new trace file format for query tracing and replay and trace file version is bump up to 0.2. A payload map is added as the first portion of the payload. We will not have backward compatible issues when adding new entries to trace records. Added the iterator_upper_bound and iterator_lower_bound in Seek and SeekForPrev tracing function. Added them as the new payload member for iterator tracing.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md418"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add support for key-value integrity protection in live updates from the user buffers provided to <code>WriteBatch</code> through the write to RocksDB's in-memory update buffer (memtable). This is intended to detect some cases of in-memory data corruption, due to either software or hardware errors. Users can enable protection by constructing their <code>WriteBatch</code> with <code>protection_bytes_per_key == 8</code>.</li>
<li>Add support for updating <code>full_history_ts_low</code> option in manual compaction, which is for old timestamp data GC.</li>
<li>Add a mechanism for using Makefile to build external plugin code into the RocksDB libraries/binaries. This intends to simplify compatibility and distribution for plugins (e.g., special-purpose <code>FileSystem</code>s) whose source code resides outside the RocksDB repo. See "plugin/README.md" for developer details, and "PLUGINS.md" for a listing of available plugins.</li>
<li>Added memory pre-fetching for experimental Ribbon filter, which especially optimizes performance with batched MultiGet.</li>
<li>A new, experimental version of BlobDB (key-value separation) is now available. The new implementation is integrated into the RocksDB core, i.e. it is accessible via the usual <code>rocksdb::DB</code> API, as opposed to the separate <code>rocksdb::blob_db::BlobDB</code> interface used by the earlier version, and can be configured on a per-column family basis using the configuration options <code>enable_blob_files</code>, <code>min_blob_size</code>, <code>blob_file_size</code>, <code>blob_compression_type</code>, <code>enable_blob_garbage_collection</code>, and <code>blob_garbage_collection_age_cutoff</code>. It extends RocksDB's consistency guarantees to blobs, and offers more features and better performance. Note that some features, most notably <code>Merge</code>, compaction filters, and backup/restore are not yet supported, and there is no support for migrating a database created by the old implementation.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Since 6.15.0, <code>TransactionDB</code> returns error <code>Status</code>es from calls to <code>DeleteRange()</code> and calls to <code>Write()</code> where the <code>WriteBatch</code> contains a range deletion. Previously such operations may have succeeded while not providing the expected transactional guarantees. There are certain cases where range deletion can still be used on such DBs; see the API doc on <code>TransactionDB::DeleteRange()</code> for details.</li>
<li><code>OptimisticTransactionDB</code> now returns error <code>Status</code>es from calls to <code>DeleteRange()</code> and calls to <code>Write()</code> where the <code>WriteBatch</code> contains a range deletion. Previously such operations may have succeeded while not providing the expected transactional guarantees.</li>
<li>Fix <code>WRITE_PREPARED</code>, <code>WRITE_UNPREPARED</code> TransactionDB <code>MultiGet()</code> may return uncommitted data with snapshot.</li>
<li>In DB::OpenForReadOnly, if any error happens while checking Manifest file path, it was overridden by Status::NotFound. It has been fixed and now actual error is returned.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md420"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a "only_mutable_options" flag to the ConfigOptions. When this flag is "true", the Configurable functions and convenience methods (such as GetDBOptionsFromString) will only deal with options that are marked as mutable. When this flag is true, only options marked as mutable can be configured (a Status::InvalidArgument will be returned) and options not marked as mutable will not be returned or compared. The default is "false", meaning to compare all options.</li>
<li>Add new Append and PositionedAppend APIs to FileSystem to bring the data verification information (data checksum information) from upper layer (e.g., WritableFileWriter) to the storage layer. In this way, the customized FileSystem is able to verify the correctness of data being written to the storage on time. Add checksum_handoff_file_types to DBOptions. User can use this option to control which file types (Currently supported file tyes: kWALFile, kTableFile, kDescriptorFile.) should use the new Append and PositionedAppend APIs to handoff the verification information. Currently, RocksDB only use crc32c to calculate the checksum for write handoff.</li>
<li>Add an option, <code>CompressionOptions::max_dict_buffer_bytes</code>, to limit the in-memory buffering for selecting samples for generating/training a dictionary. The limit is currently loosely adhered to.</li>

<ul>
<li>When verifying full file checksum with <code>DB::VerifyFileChecksums()</code>, we now fail with <code>Status::InvalidArgument</code> if the name of the checksum generator used for verification does not match the name of the checksum generator used for protecting the file when it was created.</li>
<li>Since RocksDB does not continue write the same file if a file write fails for any reason, the file scope write IO error is treated the same as retryable IO error. More information about error handling of file scope IO error is included in <code>ErrorHandler::SetBGError</code>.</li>
</ul>

<li>Add a SystemClock class that contains the time-related methods from Env. The original methods in Env may be deprecated in a future release. This class will allow easier testing, development, and expansion of time-related features.</li>
<li>Add a public API GetRocksBuildProperties and GetRocksBuildInfoAsString to get properties about the current build. These properties may include settings related to the GIT settings (branch, timestamp). This change also sets the "build date" based on the GIT properties, rather than the actual build time, thereby enabling more reproducible builds.</li>

<ul>
<li>Truncated WALs ending in incomplete records can no longer produce gaps in the recovered data when <code>WALRecoveryMode::kPointInTimeRecovery</code> is used. Gaps are still possible when WALs are truncated exactly on record boundaries; for complete protection, users should enable <code>track_and_verify_wals_in_manifest</code>.</li>
<li>Fix a bug where compressed blocks read by MultiGet are not inserted into the compressed block cache when use_direct_reads = true.</li>
<li>Fixed the issue of full scanning on obsolete files when there are too many outstanding compactions with ConcurrentTaskLimiter enabled.</li>
<li>Fixed the logic of populating native data structure for <code>read_amp_bytes_per_bit</code> during OPTIONS file parsing on big-endian architecture. Without this fix, original code introduced in PR7659, when running on big-endian machine, can mistakenly store read_amp_bytes_per_bit (an uint32) in little endian format. Future access to <code>read_amp_bytes_per_bit</code> will give wrong values. Little endian architecture is not affected.</li>
<li>Fixed prefix extractor with timestamp issues.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in atomic flush: in two-phase commit mode, the minimum WAL log number to keep is incorrect.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug related to checkpoint in PR7789: if there are multiple column families, and the checkpoint is not opened as read only, then in rare cases, data loss may happen in the checkpoint. Since backup engine relies on checkpoint, it may also be affected.</li>
<li>When ldb &ndash;try_load_options is used with the &ndash;column_family option, the ColumnFamilyOptions for the specified column family was not loaded from the OPTIONS file. Fix it so its loaded from OPTIONS and then overridden with command line overrides.</li>

<li>To improve portability the functions <code>Env::GetChildren</code> and <code>Env::GetChildrenFileAttributes</code> will no longer return entries for the special directories <code>.</code> or <code>..</code>.</li>
<li>Added a new option <code>track_and_verify_wals_in_manifest</code>. If <code>true</code>, the log numbers and sizes of the synced WALs are tracked in MANIFEST, then during DB recovery, if a synced WAL is missing from disk, or the WAL's size does not match the recorded size in MANIFEST, an error will be reported and the recovery will be aborted. Note that this option does not work with secondary instance.</li>
<li><code>rocksdb_approximate_sizes</code> and <code>rocksdb_approximate_sizes_cf</code> in the C API now requires an error pointer (<code>char** errptr</code>) for receiving any error.</li>

<li>Fixed a bug in the following combination of features: indexes with user keys (<code>format_version &gt;= 3</code>), indexes are partitioned (<code>index_type == kTwoLevelIndexSearch</code>), and some index partitions are pinned in memory (<code>BlockBasedTableOptions::pin_l0_filter_and_index_blocks_in_cache</code>). The bug could cause keys to be truncated when read from the index leading to wrong read results or other unexpected behavior.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug when indexes are partitioned (<code>index_type == kTwoLevelIndexSearch</code>), some index partitions are pinned in memory (<code>BlockBasedTableOptions::pin_l0_filter_and_index_blocks_in_cache</code>), and partitions reads could be mixed between block cache and directly from the file (e.g., with <code>enable_index_compression == 1</code> and <code>mmap_read == 1</code>, partitions that were stored uncompressed due to poor compression ratio would be read directly from the file via mmap, while partitions that were stored compressed would be read from block cache). The bug could cause index partitions to be mistakenly considered empty during reads leading to wrong read results.</li>
<li>Since 6.12, memtable lookup should report unrecognized value_type as corruption (#7121).</li>
<li>Since 6.14, fix false positive flush/compaction <code>Status::Corruption</code> failure when <code>paranoid_file_checks == true</code> and range tombstones were written to the compaction output files.</li>
<li>Since 6.14, fix a bug that could cause a stalled write to crash with mixed of slowdown and no_slowdown writes (<code>WriteOptions.no_slowdown=true</code>).</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which causes hang in closing DB when refit level is set in opt build. It was because ContinueBackgroundWork() was called in assert statement which is a no op. It was introduced in 6.14.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug which causes Get() to return incorrect result when a key's merge operand is applied twice. This can occur if the thread performing Get() runs concurrently with a background flush thread and another thread writing to the MANIFEST file (PR6069).</li>
<li>Reverted a behavior change silently introduced in 6.14.2, in which the effects of the <code>ignore_unknown_options</code> flag (used in option parsing/loading functions) changed.</li>
<li>Reverted a behavior change silently introduced in 6.14, in which options parsing/loading functions began returning <code>NotFound</code> instead of <code>InvalidArgument</code> for option names not available in the present version.</li>
<li>Fixed MultiGet bugs it doesn't return valid data with user defined timestamp.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential bug caused by evaluating <code>TableBuilder::NeedCompact()</code> before <code>TableBuilder::Finish()</code> in compaction job. For example, the <code>NeedCompact()</code> method of <code>CompactOnDeletionCollector</code> returned by built-in <code>CompactOnDeletionCollectorFactory</code> requires <code>BlockBasedTable::Finish()</code> to return the correct result. The bug can cause a compaction-generated file not to be marked for future compaction based on deletion ratio.</li>
<li>Fixed a seek issue with prefix extractor and timestamp.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug of encoding and parsing BlockBasedTableOptions::read_amp_bytes_per_bit as a 64-bit integer.</li>

Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Deprecate <code>BlockBasedTableOptions::pin_l0_filter_and_index_blocks_in_cache</code> and <code>BlockBasedTableOptions::pin_top_level_index_and_filter</code>. These options still take effect until users migrate to the replacement APIs in <code>BlockBasedTableOptions::metadata_cache_options</code>. Migration guidance can be found in the API comments on the deprecated options.</li>
<li>Add new API <code>DB::VerifyFileChecksums</code> to verify SST file checksum with corresponding entries in the MANIFEST if present. Current implementation requires scanning and recomputing file checksums.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md433"></a>
Behavior Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>The dictionary compression settings specified in <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::compression_opts</code> now additionally affect files generated by flush and compaction to non-bottommost level. Previously those settings at most affected files generated by compaction to bottommost level, depending on whether <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::bottommost_compression_opts</code> overrode them. Users who relied on dictionary compression settings in <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::compression_opts</code> affecting only the bottommost level can keep the behavior by moving their dictionary settings to <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::bottommost_compression_opts</code> and setting its <code>enabled</code> flag.</li>
<li>When the <code>enabled</code> flag is set in <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::bottommost_compression_opts</code>, those compression options now take effect regardless of the value in <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::bottommost_compression</code>. Previously, those compression options only took effect when <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::bottommost_compression != kDisableCompressionOption</code>. Now, they additionally take effect when <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::bottommost_compression == kDisableCompressionOption</code> (such a setting causes bottommost compression type to fall back to <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::compression_per_level</code> if configured, and otherwise fall back to <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::compression</code>).</li>

Bug fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a bug after a <code>CompactRange()</code> with <code>CompactRangeOptions::change_level</code> set fails due to a conflict in the level change step, which caused all subsequent calls to <code>CompactRange()</code> with <code>CompactRangeOptions::change_level</code> set to incorrectly fail with a <code>Status::NotSupported("another thread is refitting")</code> error.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug that the bottom most level compaction could still be a trivial move even if <code>BottommostLevelCompaction.kForce</code> or <code>kForceOptimized</code> is set.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md437"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>The methods to create and manage EncrypedEnv have been changed. The EncryptionProvider is now passed to NewEncryptedEnv as a shared pointer, rather than a raw pointer. Comparably, the CTREncryptedProvider now takes a shared pointer, rather than a reference, to a BlockCipher. CreateFromString methods have been added to BlockCipher and EncryptionProvider to provide a single API by which different ciphers and providers can be created, respectively.</li>
<li>The internal classes (CTREncryptionProvider, ROT13BlockCipher, CTRCipherStream) associated with the EncryptedEnv have been moved out of the public API. To create a CTREncryptionProvider, one can either use EncryptionProvider::NewCTRProvider, or EncryptionProvider::CreateFromString("CTR"). To create a new ROT13BlockCipher, one can either use BlockCipher::NewROT13Cipher or BlockCipher::CreateFromString("ROT13").</li>
<li>The EncryptionProvider::AddCipher method has been added to allow keys to be added to an EncryptionProvider. This API will allow future providers to support multiple cipher keys.</li>
<li>Add a new option "allow_data_in_errors". When this new option is set by users, it allows users to opt-in to get error messages containing corrupted keys/values. Corrupt keys, values will be logged in the messages, logs, status etc. that will help users with the useful information regarding affected data. By default value of this option is set false to prevent users data to be exposed in the messages so currently, data will be redacted from logs, messages, status by default.</li>
<li>AdvancedColumnFamilyOptions::force_consistency_checks is now true by default, for more proactive DB corruption detection at virtually no cost (estimated two extra CPU cycles per million on a major production workload). Corruptions reported by these checks now mention "force_consistency_checks" in case a false positive corruption report is suspected and the option needs to be disabled (unlikely). Since existing column families have a saved setting for force_consistency_checks, only new column families will pick up the new default.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md438"></a>
General Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>The settings of the DBOptions and ColumnFamilyOptions are now managed by Configurable objects (see New Features). The same convenience methods to configure these options still exist but the backend implementation has been unified under a common implementation.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md439"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Methods to configure serialize, and compare &ndash; such as TableFactory &ndash; are exposed directly through the Configurable base class (from which these objects inherit). This change will allow for better and more thorough configuration management and retrieval in the future. The options for a Configurable object can be set via the ConfigureFromMap, ConfigureFromString, or ConfigureOption method. The serialized version of the options of an object can be retrieved via the GetOptionString, ToString, or GetOption methods. The list of options supported by an object can be obtained via the GetOptionNames method. The "raw" object (such as the BlockBasedTableOption) for an option may be retrieved via the GetOptions method. Configurable options can be compared via the AreEquivalent method. The settings within a Configurable object may be validated via the ValidateOptions method. The object may be intialized (at which point only mutable options may be updated) via the PrepareOptions method.</li>
<li>Introduce options.check_flush_compaction_key_order with default value to be true. With this option, during flush and compaction, key order will be checked when writing to each SST file. If the order is violated, the flush or compaction will fail.</li>
<li>Added is_full_compaction to CompactionJobStats, so that the information is available through the EventListener interface.</li>
<li>Add more stats for MultiGet in Histogram to get number of data blocks, index blocks, filter blocks and sst files read from file system per level.</li>
<li>SST files have a new table property called db_host_id, which is set to the hostname by default. A new option in DBOptions, db_host_id, allows the property value to be overridden with a user specified string, or disable it completely by making the option string empty.</li>
<li>Methods to create customizable extensions &ndash; such as TableFactory &ndash; are exposed directly through the Customizable base class (from which these objects inherit). This change will allow these Customizable classes to be loaded and configured in a standard way (via CreateFromString). More information on how to write and use Customizable classes is in the <a class="el" href="customizable_8h_source.html">customizable.h</a> header file.</li>

<li>Fix a performance regression introduced in 6.4 that makes a upper bound check for every Next() even if keys are within a data block that is within the upper bound.</li>
<li>Fix a possible corruption to the LSM state (overlapping files within a level) when a <code>CompactRange()</code> for refitting levels (<code>CompactRangeOptions::change_level == true</code>) and another manual compaction are executed in parallel.</li>
<li>Sanitize <code>recycle_log_file_num</code> to zero when the user attempts to enable it in combination with <code>WALRecoveryMode::kTolerateCorruptedTailRecords</code>. Previously the two features were allowed together, which compromised the user's configured crash-recovery guarantees.</li>
<li>Fix a bug where a level refitting in CompactRange() might race with an automatic compaction that puts the data to the target level of the refitting. The bug has been there for years.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in version 6.12 in which BackupEngine::CreateNewBackup could fail intermittently with non-OK status when backing up a read-write DB configured with a DBOptions::file_checksum_gen_factory.</li>
<li>Fix useless no-op compactions scheduled upon snapshot release when options.disable-auto-compactions = true.</li>
<li>Fix a bug when max_write_buffer_size_to_maintain is set, immutable flushed memtable destruction is delayed until the next super version is installed. A memtable is not added to delete list because of its reference hold by super version and super version doesn't switch because of empt delete list. So memory usage keeps on increasing beyond write_buffer_size + max_write_buffer_size_to_maintain.</li>
<li>Avoid converting MERGES to PUTS when allow_ingest_behind is true.</li>
<li>Fix compression dictionary sampling together with <code>SstFileWriter</code>. Previously, the dictionary would be trained/finalized immediately with zero samples. Now, the whole <code>SstFileWriter</code> file is buffered in memory and then sampled.</li>
<li>Fix a bug with <code>avoid_unnecessary_blocking_io=1</code> and creating backups (BackupEngine::CreateNewBackup) or checkpoints (Checkpoint::Create). With this setting and WAL enabled, these operations could randomly fail with non-OK status.</li>
<li>Fix a bug in which bottommost compaction continues to advance the underlying InternalIterator to skip tombstones even after shutdown.</li>

<li>Reduce write-amp in heavy write bursts in <code>kCompactionStyleLevel</code> compaction style with <code>level_compaction_dynamic_level_bytes</code> set.</li>
<li>BackupEngine incremental backups no longer read DB table files that are already saved to a shared part of the backup directory, unless <code>share_files_with_checksum</code> is used with <code>kLegacyCrc32cAndFileSize</code> naming (discouraged).<ul>
<li>For <code>share_files_with_checksum</code>, we are confident there is no regression (vs. pre-6.12) in detecting DB or backup corruption at backup creation time, mostly because the old design did not leverage this extra checksum computation for detecting inconsistencies at backup creation time.</li>
<li>For <code>share_table_files</code> without "checksum" (not recommended), there is a regression in detecting fundamentally unsafe use of the option, greatly mitigated by file size checking (under "Behavior Changes"). Almost no reason to use <code>share_files_with_checksum=false</code> should remain.</li>

<li>Added file_checksum and file_checksum_func_name to TableFileCreationInfo, which can pass the table file checksum information through the OnTableFileCreated callback during flush and compaction.</li>
<li>A warning is added to <code>DB::DeleteFile()</code> API describing its known problems and deprecation plan.</li>
<li>Add a new stats level, i.e. StatsLevel::kExceptTickers (PR7329) to exclude tickers even if application passes a non-null Statistics object.</li>
<li>Added a new status code IOStatus::IOFenced() for the Env/FileSystem to indicate that writes from this instance are fenced off. Like any other background error, this error is returned to the user in Put/Merge/Delete/Flush calls and can be checked using Status::IsIOFenced().</li>

<li><a class="el" href="classFile.html" title="File object to represent a file in the autotier filesystem.">File</a> abstraction <code>FSRandomAccessFile.Prefetch()</code> default return status is changed from <code>OK</code> to <code>NotSupported</code>. If the user inherited file doesn't implement prefetch, RocksDB will create internal prefetch buffer to improve read performance.</li>
<li>When retryabel IO error happens during Flush (manifest write error is excluded) and WAL is disabled, originally it is mapped to kHardError. Now,it is mapped to soft error. So DB will not stall the writes unless the memtable is full. At the same time, when auto resume is triggered to recover the retryable IO error during Flush, SwitchMemtable is not called to avoid generating to many small immutable memtables. If WAL is enabled, no behavior changes.</li>
<li>When considering whether a table file is already backed up in a shared part of backup directory, BackupEngine would already query the sizes of source (DB) and pre-existing destination (backup) files. BackupEngine now uses these file sizes to detect corruption, as at least one of (a) old backup, (b) backup in progress, or (c) current DB is corrupt if there's a size mismatch.</li>

<li><code>DB::GetDbSessionId(std::string&amp; session_id)</code> is added. <code>session_id</code> stores a unique identifier that gets reset every time the DB is opened.

This identifier is recorded in the LOG file on the line starting with "DB Session ID:".</li>
<li><code>DB::OpenForReadOnly()</code> now returns <code>Status::NotFound</code> when the specified DB directory does not exist. Previously the error returned depended on the underlying <code>Env</code>. This change is available in all 6.11 releases as well.</li>
<li>A parameter <code>verify_with_checksum</code> is added to <code>BackupEngine::VerifyBackup</code>, which is false by default. If it is ture, <code>BackupEngine::VerifyBackup</code> verifies checksums and file sizes of backup files.

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md449"></a>
Behavior Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Best-efforts recovery ignores CURRENT file completely. If CURRENT file is missing during recovery, best-efforts recovery still proceeds with MANIFEST file(s).</li>
<li>In best-efforts recovery, an error that is not Corruption or IOError::kNotFound or IOError::kPathNotFound will be overwritten silently. Fix this by checking all non-ok cases and return early.</li>
<li>When <code>file_checksum_gen_factory</code> is set to <code>GetFileChecksumGenCrc32cFactory()</code>, BackupEngine will compare the crc32c checksums of table files computed when creating a backup to the expected checksums stored in the DB manifest, and will fail <code>CreateNewBackup()</code> on mismatch (corruption). If the <code>file_checksum_gen_factory</code> is not set or set to any other customized factory, there is no checksum verification to detect if SST files in a DB are corrupt when read, copied, and independently checksummed by BackupEngine.</li>
<li>When a DB sets <code>stats_dump_period_sec &gt; 0</code>, either as the initial value for DB open or as a dynamic option change, the first stats dump is staggered in the following X seconds, where X is an integer in <code>[0, stats_dump_period_sec)</code>. Subsequent stats dumps are still spaced <code>stats_dump_period_sec</code> seconds apart.</li>
<li>When the paranoid_file_checks option is true, a hash is generated of all keys and values are generated when the SST file is written, and then the values are read back in to validate the file. A corruption is signaled if the two hashes do not match.</li>

New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>DB identity (<code>db_id</code>) and DB session identity (<code>db_session_id</code>) are added to table properties and stored in SST files. SST files generated from SstFileWriter and Repairer have DB identity “SST Writer” and “DB Repairer”, respectively. Their DB session IDs are generated in the same way as <code>DB::GetDbSessionId</code>. The session ID for SstFileWriter (resp., Repairer) resets every time <code>SstFileWriter::Open</code> (resp., <code>Repairer::Run</code>) is called.</li>
<li>Added experimental option BlockBasedTableOptions::optimize_filters_for_memory for reducing allocated memory size of Bloom filters (~10% savings with Jemalloc) while preserving the same general accuracy. To have an effect, the option requires format_version=5 and malloc_usable_size. Enabling this option is forward and backward compatible with existing format_version=5.</li>
<li><code>BackupableDBOptions::share_files_with_checksum_naming</code> is added with new default behavior for naming backup files with <code>share_files_with_checksum</code>, to address performance and backup integrity issues. See API comments for details.</li>
<li>Added auto resume function to automatically recover the DB from background Retryable IO Error. When retryable IOError happens during flush and WAL write, the error is mapped to Hard Error and DB will be in read mode. When retryable IO Error happens during compaction, the error will be mapped to Soft Error. DB is still in write/read mode. Autoresume function will create a thread for a DB to call DB-&gt;ResumeImpl() to try the recover for Retryable IO Error during flush and WAL write. Compaction will be rescheduled by itself if retryable IO Error happens. Auto resume may also cause other Retryable IO Error during the recovery, so the recovery will fail. Retry the auto resume may solve the issue, so we use max_bgerror_resume_count to decide how many resume cycles will be tried in total. If it is &lt;=0, auto resume retryable IO Error is disabled. Default is INT_MAX, which will lead to a infinit auto resume. bgerror_resume_retry_interval decides the time interval between two auto resumes.</li>
<li>Option <code>max_subcompactions</code> can be set dynamically using DB::SetDBOptions().</li>
<li>Added experimental ColumnFamilyOptions::sst_partitioner_factory to define determine the partitioning of sst files. This helps compaction to split the files on interesting boundaries (key prefixes) to make propagation of sst files less write amplifying (covering the whole key space).</li>

<li>Fix a use-after-free bug in best-efforts recovery. column_family_memtables_ needs to point to valid ColumnFamilySet.</li>
<li>Let best-efforts recovery ignore corrupted files during table loading.</li>
<li>Fix corrupt key read from ingested file when iterator direction switches from reverse to forward at a key that is a prefix of another key in the same file. It is only possible in files with a non-zero global seqno.</li>
<li>Fix abnormally large estimate from GetApproximateSizes when a range starts near the end of one SST file and near the beginning of another.

<li>DeleteRange now returns <code>Status::InvalidArgument</code> if the range's end key comes before its start key according to the user comparator. Previously the behavior was undefined.</li>

<li>DB::OpenForReadOnly no longer creates files or directories if the named DB does not exist, unless create_if_missing is set to true.</li>
<li>The consistency checks that validate LSM state changes (table file additions/deletions during flushes and compactions) are now stricter, more efficient, and no longer optional, i.e. they are performed even if <code>force_consistency_checks</code> is <code>false</code>.</li>
<li>Disable delete triggered compaction (NewCompactOnDeletionCollectorFactory) in universal compaction mode and num_levels = 1 in order to avoid a corruption bug.</li>
<li><code>pin_l0_filter_and_index_blocks_in_cache</code> no longer applies to L0 files larger than <code>1.5 * write_buffer_size</code> to give more predictable memory usage. Such L0 files may exist due to intra-L0 compaction, external file ingestion, or user dynamically changing <code>write_buffer_size</code> (note, however, that files that are already pinned will continue being pinned, even after such a dynamic change).</li>
<li>In point-in-time wal recovery mode, fail database recovery in case of IOError while reading the WAL to avoid data loss.</li>
<li>A new method <code>Env::LowerThreadPoolCPUPriority(Priority, CpuPriority)</code> is added to <code>Env</code> to be able to lower to a specific priority such as <code>CpuPriority::kIdle</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md456"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>sst_dump to add a new &ndash;readahead_size argument. Users can specify read size when scanning the data. Sst_dump also tries to prefetch tail part of the SST files so usually some number of I/Os are saved there too.</li>
<li>Generate file checksum in SstFileWriter if Options.file_checksum_gen_factory is set. The checksum and checksum function name are stored in ExternalSstFileInfo after the sst file write is finished.</li>
<li>Add a value_size_soft_limit in read options which limits the cumulative value size of keys read in batches in MultiGet. Once the cumulative value size of found keys exceeds read_options.value_size_soft_limit, all the remaining keys are returned with status Abort without further finding their values. By default the value_size_soft_limit is std::numeric_limits&lt;uint64_t&gt;::max().</li>
<li>Enable SST file ingestion with file checksum information when calling IngestExternalFiles(const std::vector&lt;IngestExternalFileArg&gt;&amp; args). Added files_checksums and files_checksum_func_names to IngestExternalFileArg such that user can ingest the sst files with their file checksum information. Added verify_file_checksum to IngestExternalFileOptions (default is True). To be backward compatible, if DB does not enable file checksum or user does not provide checksum information (vectors of files_checksums and files_checksum_func_names are both empty), verification of file checksum is always sucessful. If DB enables file checksum, DB will always generate the checksum for each ingested SST file during Prepare stage of ingestion and store the checksum in Manifest, unless verify_file_checksum is False and checksum information is provided by the application. In this case, we only verify the checksum function name and directly store the ingested checksum in Manifest. If verify_file_checksum is set to True, DB will verify the ingested checksum and function name with the genrated ones. Any mismatch will fail the ingestion. Note that, if IngestExternalFileOptions::write_global_seqno is True, the seqno will be changed in the ingested file. Therefore, the checksum of the file will be changed. In this case, a new checksum will be generated after the seqno is updated and be stored in the Manifest.</li>

<li>Finish implementation of BlockBasedTableOptions::IndexType::kBinarySearchWithFirstKey. It's now ready for use. Significantly reduces read amplification in some setups, especially for iterator seeks.</li>
<li>Fix a bug by updating CURRENT file so that it points to the correct MANIFEST file after best-efforts recovery.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where ColumnFamilyHandle objects were not cleaned up in case an error happened during BlobDB's open after the base DB had been opened.</li>
<li>Fix a potential undefined behavior caused by trying to dereference nullable pointer (timestamp argument) in DB::MultiGet.</li>
<li>Fix a bug caused by not including user timestamp in MultiGet LookupKey construction. This can lead to wrong query result since the trailing bytes of a user key, if not shorter than timestamp, will be mistaken for user timestamp.</li>
<li>Fix a bug caused by using wrong compare function when sorting the input keys of MultiGet with timestamps.</li>
<li>Upgraded version of bzip library (1.0.6 -&gt; 1.0.8) used with RocksJava to address potential vulnerabilities if an attacker can manipulate compressed data saved and loaded by RocksDB (not normal). See issue #6703.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md460"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a ConfigOptions argument to the APIs dealing with converting options to and from strings and files. The ConfigOptions is meant to replace some of the options (such as input_strings_escaped and ignore_unknown_options) and allow for more parameters to be passed in the future without changing the function signature.</li>
<li>Add NewFileChecksumGenCrc32cFactory to the file checksum public API, such that the builtin Crc32c based file checksum generator factory can be used by applications.</li>
<li>Add IsDirectory to Env and FS to indicate if a path is a directory.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md461"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added support for pipelined &amp; parallel compression optimization for <code>BlockBasedTableBuilder</code>. This optimization makes block building, block compression and block appending a pipeline, and uses multiple threads to accelerate block compression. Users can set <code>CompressionOptions::parallel_threads</code> greater than 1 to enable compression parallelism. This feature is experimental for now.</li>
<li>Provide an allocator for memkind to be used with block cache. This is to work with memory technologies (Intel DCPMM is one such technology currently available) that require different libraries for allocation and management (such as PMDK and memkind). The high capacities available make it possible to provision large caches (up to several TBs in size) beyond what is achievable with DRAM.</li>
<li>Option <code>max_background_flushes</code> can be set dynamically using DB::SetDBOptions().</li>
<li>Added functionality in sst_dump tool to check the compressed file size for different compression levels and print the time spent on compressing files with each compression type. Added arguments <code>--compression_level_from</code> and <code>--compression_level_to</code> to report size of all compression levels and one compression_type must be specified with it so that it will report compressed sizes of one compression type with different levels.</li>
<li>Added statistics for redundant insertions into block cache: rocksdb.block.cache.*add.redundant. (There is currently no coordination to ensure that only one thread loads a table block when many threads are trying to access that same table block.)</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md462"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug when making options.bottommost_compression, options.compression_opts and options.bottommost_compression_opts dynamically changeable: the modified values are not written to option files or returned back to users when being queried.</li>
<li>Fix a bug where index key comparisons were unaccounted in <code>PerfContext::user_key_comparison_count</code> for lookups in files written with <code>format_version &gt;= 3</code>.</li>
<li>Fix many bloom.filter statistics not being updated in batch MultiGet.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md463"></a>

6.9.0 (2020-03-29)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md465"></a>
Behavior changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Since RocksDB 6.8, ttl-based FIFO compaction can drop a file whose oldest key becomes older than options.ttl while others have not. This fix reverts this and makes ttl-based FIFO compaction use the file's flush time as the criterion. This fix also requires that max_open_files = -1 and compaction_options_fifo.allow_compaction = false to function properly.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md466"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix spelling so that API now has correctly spelled transaction state name <code>COMMITTED</code>, while the old misspelled <code>COMMITED</code> is still available as an alias.</li>
<li>Updated default format_version in BlockBasedTableOptions from 2 to 4. SST files generated with the new default can be read by RocksDB versions 5.16 and newer, and use more efficient encoding of keys in index blocks.</li>
<li>A new parameter <code>CreateBackupOptions</code> is added to both <code>BackupEngine::CreateNewBackup</code> and <code>BackupEngine::CreateNewBackupWithMetadata</code>, you can decrease CPU priority of <code>BackupEngine</code>'s background threads by setting <code>decrease_background_thread_cpu_priority</code> and <code>background_thread_cpu_priority</code> in <code>CreateBackupOptions</code>.</li>
<li>Updated the public API of SST file checksum. Introduce the FileChecksumGenFactory to create the FileChecksumGenerator for each SST file, such that the FileChecksumGenerator is not shared and it can be more general for checksum implementations. Changed the FileChecksumGenerator interface from Value, Extend, and GetChecksum to Update, Finalize, and GetChecksum. Finalize should be only called once after all data is processed to generate the final checksum. Temproal data should be maintained by the FileChecksumGenerator object itself and finally it can return the checksum string.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md467"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix a bug where range tombstone blocks in ingested files were cached incorrectly during ingestion. If range tombstones were read from those incorrectly cached blocks, the keys they covered would be exposed.</li>
<li>Fix a data race that might cause crash when calling DB::GetCreationTimeOfOldestFile() by a small chance. The bug was introduced in 6.6 Release.</li>
<li>Fix a bug where a boolean value optimize_filters_for_hits was for max threads when calling load table handles after a flush or compaction. The value is correct to 1. The bug should not cause user visible problems.</li>
<li>Fix a bug which might crash the service when write buffer manager fails to insert the dummy handle to the block cache.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md468"></a>
Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>In CompactRange, for levels starting from 0, if the level does not have any file with any key falling in the specified range, the level is skipped. So instead of always compacting from level 0, the compaction starts from the first level with keys in the specified range until the last such level.</li>
<li>Reduced memory copy when reading sst footer and blobdb in direct IO mode.</li>
<li>When restarting a database with large numbers of sst files, large amount of CPU time is spent on getting logical block size of the sst files, which slows down the starting progress, this inefficiency is optimized away with an internal cache for the logical block sizes.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md469"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic support for user timestamp in iterator. Seek/SeekToFirst/Next and lower/upper bounds are supported. Reverse iteration is not supported. Merge is not considered.</li>
<li>When file lock failure when the lock is held by the current process, return acquiring time and thread ID in the error message.</li>
<li>Added a new option, best_efforts_recovery (default: false), to allow database to open in a db dir with missing table files. During best efforts recovery, missing table files are ignored, and database recovers to the most recent state without missing table file. Cross-column-family consistency is not guaranteed even if WAL is enabled.</li>
<li>options.bottommost_compression, options.compression_opts and options.bottommost_compression_opts are now dynamically changeable.</li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md472"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fix incorrect results while block-based table uses kHashSearch, together with Prev()/SeekForPrev().</li>
<li>Fix a bug that prevents opening a DB after two consecutive crash with TransactionDB, where the first crash recovers from a corrupted WAL with kPointInTimeRecovery but the second cannot.</li>
<li>Fixed issue #6316 that can cause a corruption of the MANIFEST file in the middle when writing to it fails due to no disk space.</li>
<li>Add DBOptions::skip_checking_sst_file_sizes_on_db_open. It disables potentially expensive checking of all sst file sizes in DB::Open().</li>
<li>BlobDB now ignores trivially moved files when updating the mapping between blob files and SSTs. This should mitigate issue #6338 where out of order flush/compaction notifications could trigger an assertion with the earlier code.</li>
<li>Batched MultiGet() ignores IO errors while reading data blocks, causing it to potentially continue looking for a key and returning stale results.</li>
<li><code>WriteBatchWithIndex::DeleteRange</code> returns <code>Status::NotSupported</code>. Previously it returned success even though reads on the batch did not account for range tombstones. The corresponding language bindings now cannot be used. In C, that includes <code>rocksdb_writebatch_wi_delete_range</code>, <code>rocksdb_writebatch_wi_delete_range_cf</code>, <code>rocksdb_writebatch_wi_delete_rangev</code>, and <code>rocksdb_writebatch_wi_delete_rangev_cf</code>. In Java, that includes <code>WriteBatchWithIndex::deleteRange</code>.</li>
<li>Assign new MANIFEST file number when caller tries to create a new MANIFEST by calling LogAndApply(..., new_descriptor_log=true). This bug can cause MANIFEST being overwritten during recovery if options.write_dbid_to_manifest = true and there are WAL file(s).</li>

</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md474"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>The BlobDB garbage collector now emits the statistics <code>BLOB_DB_GC_NUM_FILES</code> (number of blob files obsoleted during GC), <code>BLOB_DB_GC_NUM_NEW_FILES</code> (number of new blob files generated during GC), <code>BLOB_DB_GC_FAILURES</code> (number of failed GC passes), <code>BLOB_DB_GC_NUM_KEYS_RELOCATED</code> (number of blobs relocated during GC), and <code>BLOB_DB_GC_BYTES_RELOCATED</code> (total size of blobs relocated during GC). On the other hand, the following statistics, which are not relevant for the new GC implementation, are now deprecated: <code>BLOB_DB_GC_NUM_KEYS_OVERWRITTEN</code>, <code>BLOB_DB_GC_NUM_KEYS_EXPIRED</code>, <code>BLOB_DB_GC_BYTES_OVERWRITTEN</code>, <code>BLOB_DB_GC_BYTES_EXPIRED</code>, and <code>BLOB_DB_GC_MICROS</code>.</li>
<li>Disable recycle_log_file_num when an inconsistent recovery modes are requested: kPointInTimeRecovery and kAbsoluteConsistency</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md475"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added the checksum for each SST file generated by Flush or Compaction. Added sst_file_checksum_func to Options such that user can plugin their own SST file checksum function via override the FileChecksumFunc class. If user does not set the sst_file_checksum_func, SST file checksum calculation will not be enabled. The checksum information inlcuding uint32_t checksum value and a checksum function name (string). The checksum information is stored in FileMetadata in version store and also logged to MANIFEST. A new tool is added to LDB such that user can dump out a list of file checksum information from MANIFEST (stored in an unordered_map).</li>
<li><code>db_bench</code> now supports <code>value_size_distribution_type</code>, <code>value_size_min</code>, <code>value_size_max</code> options for generating random variable sized value. Added <code>blob_db_compression_type</code> option for BlobDB to enable blob compression.</li>
<li>Replace RocksDB namespace "rocksdb" with flag "ROCKSDB_NAMESPACE" which if is not defined, defined as "rocksdb" in header file <a class="el" href="rocksdb__namespace_8h_source.html">rocksdb_namespace.h</a>.</li>

6.7.0 (2020-01-21)</h1>

Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a rocksdb::FileSystem class in <a class="el" href="file__system_8h_source.html">include/rocksdb/file_system.h</a> to encapsulate file creation/read/write operations, and an option DBOptions::file_system to allow a user to pass in an instance of rocksdb::FileSystem. If its a non-null value, this will take precendence over DBOptions::env for file operations. A new API rocksdb::FileSystem::Default() returns a platform default object. The DBOptions::env option and Env::Default() API will continue to be used for threading and other OS related functions, and where DBOptions::file_system is not specified, for file operations. For storage developers who are accustomed to rocksdb::Env, the interface in rocksdb::FileSystem is new and will probably undergo some changes as more storage systems are ported to it from rocksdb::Env. As of now, no env other than Posix has been ported to the new interface.</li>
<li>A new rocksdb::NewSstFileManager() API that allows the caller to pass in separate Env and FileSystem objects.</li>
<li>Changed Java API for RocksDB.keyMayExist functions to use Holder&lt;byte[]&gt; instead of StringBuilder, so that retrieved values need not decode to Strings.</li>
<li>A new <code>OptimisticTransactionDBOptions</code> Option that allows users to configure occ validation policy. The default policy changes from kValidateSerial to kValidateParallel to reduce mutex contention.</li>

</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md479"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>It is now possible to enable periodic compactions for the base DB when using BlobDB.</li>
<li>BlobDB now garbage collects non-TTL blobs when <code>enable_garbage_collection</code> is set to <code>true</code> in <code>BlobDBOptions</code>. Garbage collection is performed during compaction: any valid blobs located in the oldest N files (where N is the number of non-TTL blob files multiplied by the value of <code>BlobDBOptions::garbage_collection_cutoff</code>) encountered during compaction get relocated to new blob files, and old blob files are dropped once they are no longer needed. Note: we recommend enabling periodic compactions for the base DB when using this feature to deal with the case when some old blob files are kept alive by SSTs that otherwise do not get picked for compaction.</li>
<li><code>db_bench</code> now supports the <code>garbage_collection_cutoff</code> option for BlobDB.</li>
<li>Introduce ReadOptions.auto_prefix_mode. When set to true, iterator will return the same result as total order seek, but may choose to use prefix seek internally based on seek key and iterator upper bound.</li>
<li>MultiGet() can use IO Uring to parallelize read from the same SST file. This featuer is by default disabled. It can be enabled with environment variable ROCKSDB_USE_IO_URING.</li>

</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md486"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Universal compaction to support options.periodic_compaction_seconds. A full compaction will be triggered if any file is over the threshold.</li>
<li><code>GetLiveFilesMetaData</code> and <code>GetColumnFamilyMetaData</code> now expose the file number of SST files as well as the oldest blob file referenced by each SST.</li>
<li>A batched MultiGet API (DB::MultiGet()) that supports retrieving keys from multiple column families.</li>
<li>Full and partitioned filters in the block-based table use an improved Bloom filter implementation, enabled with format_version 5 (or above) because previous releases cannot read this filter. This replacement is faster and more accurate, especially for high bits per key or millions of keys in a single (full) filter. For example, the new Bloom filter has the same false positive rate at 9.55 bits per key as the old one at 10 bits per key, and a lower false positive rate at 16 bits per key than the old one at 100 bits per key.</li>
<li>Added AVX2 instructions to USE_SSE builds to accelerate the new Bloom filter and XXH3-based hash function on compatible x86_64 platforms (Haswell and later, ~2014).</li>
<li>Support options.ttl or options.periodic_compaction_seconds with options.max_open_files = -1. <a class="el" href="classFile.html" title="File object to represent a file in the autotier filesystem.">File</a>'s oldest ancester time and file creation time will be written to manifest. If it is availalbe, this information will be used instead of creation_time and file_creation_time in table properties.</li>
<li>Setting options.ttl for universal compaction now has the same meaning as setting periodic_compaction_seconds.</li>
<li>SstFileMetaData also returns file creation time and oldest ancester time.</li>
<li>The <code>sst_dump</code> command line tool <code>recompress</code> command now displays how many blocks were compressed and how many were not, in particular how many were not compressed because the compression ratio was not met (12.5% threshold for GoodCompressionRatio), as seen in the <code>number.block.not_compressed</code> counter stat since version 6.0.0.</li>
<li>The block cache usage is now takes into account the overhead of metadata per each entry. This results into more accurate management of memory. A side-effect of this feature is that less items are fit into the block cache of the same size, which would result to higher cache miss rates. This can be remedied by increasing the block cache size or passing kDontChargeCacheMetadata to its constuctor to restore the old behavior.</li>
<li>When using BlobDB, a mapping is maintained and persisted in the MANIFEST between each SST file and the oldest non-TTL blob file it references.</li>
<li><code>db_bench</code> now supports and by default issues non-TTL Puts to BlobDB. TTL Puts can be enabled by specifying a non-zero value for the <code>blob_db_max_ttl_range</code> command line parameter explicitly.</li>
<li><code>sst_dump</code> now supports printing BlobDB blob indexes in a human-readable format. This can be enabled by specifying the <code>decode_blob_index</code> flag on the command line.</li>
<li>A number of new information elements are now exposed through the EventListener interface. For flushes, the file numbers of the new SST file and the oldest blob file referenced by the SST are propagated. For compactions, the level, file number, and the oldest blob file referenced are passed to the client for each compaction input and output file.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md487"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>RocksDB release 4.1 or older will not be able to open DB generated by the new release. 4.2 was released on Feb 23, 2016.</li>
<li>TTL Compactions in Level compaction style now initiate successive cascading compactions on a key range so that it reaches the bottom level quickly on TTL expiry. <code>creation_time</code> table property for compaction output files is now set to the minimum of the creation times of all compaction inputs.</li>
<li>With FIFO compaction style, options.periodic_compaction_seconds will have the same meaning as options.ttl. Whichever stricter will be used. With the default options.periodic_compaction_seconds value with options.ttl's default of 0, RocksDB will give a default of 30 days.</li>
<li>Added an API GetCreationTimeOfOldestFile(uint64_t* creation_time) to get the file_creation_time of the oldest SST file in the DB.</li>
<li>FilterPolicy now exposes additional API to make it possible to choose filter configurations based on context, such as table level and compaction style. See <code>LevelAndStyleCustomFilterPolicy</code> in db_bloom_filter_test.cc. While most existing custom implementations of FilterPolicy should continue to work as before, those wrapping the return of NewBloomFilterPolicy will require overriding new function <code>GetBuilderWithContext()</code>, because calling <code>GetFilterBitsBuilder()</code> on the FilterPolicy returned by NewBloomFilterPolicy is no longer supported.</li>
<li>An unlikely usage of FilterPolicy is no longer supported. Calling GetFilterBitsBuilder() on the FilterPolicy returned by NewBloomFilterPolicy will now cause an assertion violation in debug builds, because RocksDB has internally migrated to a more elaborate interface that is expected to evolve further. Custom implementations of FilterPolicy should work as before, except those wrapping the return of NewBloomFilterPolicy, which will require a new override of a protected function in FilterPolicy.</li>
<li>NewBloomFilterPolicy now takes bits_per_key as a double instead of an int. This permits finer control over the memory vs. accuracy trade-off in the new Bloom filter implementation and should not change source code compatibility.</li>
<li>The option BackupableDBOptions::max_valid_backups_to_open is now only used when opening BackupEngineReadOnly. When opening a read/write BackupEngine, anything but the default value logs a warning and is treated as the default. This change ensures that backup deletion has proper accounting of shared files to ensure they are deleted when no longer referenced by a backup.</li>
<li>Deprecate <code>snap_refresh_nanos</code> option.</li>
<li>Added DisableManualCompaction/EnableManualCompaction to stop and resume manual compaction.</li>
<li>Add TryCatchUpWithPrimary() to StackableDB in non-LITE mode.</li>
<li>Add a new Env::LoadEnv() overloaded function to return a shared_ptr to Env.</li>
<li>Flush sets file name to "(nil)" for OnTableFileCreationCompleted() if the flush does not produce any L0. This can happen if the file is empty thus delete by RocksDB.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md488"></a>
Default Option Changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changed the default value of periodic_compaction_seconds to <code>UINT64_MAX - 1</code> which allows RocksDB to auto-tune periodic compaction scheduling. When using the default value, periodic compactions are now auto-enabled if a compaction filter is used. A value of <code>0</code> will turn off the feature completely.</li>
<li>Changed the default value of ttl to <code>UINT64_MAX - 1</code> which allows RocksDB to auto-tune ttl value. When using the default value, TTL will be auto-enabled to 30 days, when the feature is supported. To revert the old behavior, you can explicitly set it to 0.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md489"></a>
Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>For 64-bit hashing, RocksDB is standardizing on a slightly modified preview version of XXH3. This function is now used for many non-persisted hashes, along with fastrange64() in place of the modulus operator, and some benchmarks show a slight improvement.</li>
<li>Level iterator to invlidate the iterator more often in prefix seek and the level is filtered out by prefix bloom.</li>

6.5.0 (2019-09-13)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md495"></a>
Bug Fixes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed a number of data races in BlobDB.</li>
<li>Fix a bug where the compaction snapshot refresh feature is not disabled as advertised when <code>snap_refresh_nanos</code> is set to 0..</li>
<li>Fix bloom filter lookups by the MultiGet batching API when BlockBasedTableOptions::whole_key_filtering is false, by checking that a key is in the perfix_extractor domain and extracting the prefix before looking up.</li>
<li>Fix a bug in file ingestion caused by incorrect file number allocation when the number of column families involved in the ingestion exceeds 2.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md496"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Introduced DBOptions::max_write_batch_group_size_bytes to configure maximum limit on number of bytes that are written in a single batch of WAL or memtable write. It is followed when the leader write size is larger than 1/8 of this limit.</li>
<li>VerifyChecksum() by default will issue readahead. Allow ReadOptions to be passed in to those functions to override the readhead size. For checksum verifying before external SST file ingestion, a new option IngestExternalFileOptions.verify_checksums_readahead_size, is added for this readahead setting.</li>
<li>When user uses options.force_consistency_check in RocksDb, instead of crashing the process, we now pass the error back to the users without killing the process.</li>
<li>Add an option <code>memtable_insert_hint_per_batch</code> to WriteOptions. If it is true, each WriteBatch will maintain its own insert hints for each memtable in concurrent write. See <a class="el" href="options_8h_source.html">include/rocksdb/options.h</a> for more details.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md497"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added max_write_buffer_size_to_maintain option to better control memory usage of immutable memtables.</li>
<li>Added a lightweight API GetCurrentWalFile() to get last live WAL filename and size. Meant to be used as a helper for backup/restore tooling in a larger ecosystem such as MySQL with a MyRocks storage engine.</li>
<li>The MemTable Bloom filter, when enabled, now always uses cache locality. Options::bloom_locality now only affects the PlainTable SST format.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md498"></a>
Performance Improvements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Improve the speed of the MemTable Bloom filter, reducing the write overhead of enabling it by 1/3 to 1/2, with similar benefit to read performance.</li>
</ul>

6.4.0 (2019-07-30)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md500"></a>
Default Option Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>LRUCacheOptions.high_pri_pool_ratio is set to 0.5 (previously 0.0) by default, which means that by default midpoint insertion is enabled. The same change is made for the default value of high_pri_pool_ratio argument in NewLRUCache(). When block cache is not explicitly created, the small block cache created by BlockBasedTable will still has this option to be 0.0.</li>
<li>Change BlockBasedTableOptions.cache_index_and_filter_blocks_with_high_priority's default value from false to true.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md501"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Filter and compression dictionary blocks are now handled similarly to data blocks with regards to the block cache: instead of storing objects in the cache, only the blocks themselves are cached. In addition, filter and compression dictionary blocks (as well as filter partitions) no longer get evicted from the cache when a table is closed.</li>
<li>Due to the above refactoring, block cache eviction statistics for filter and compression dictionary blocks are temporarily broken. We plan to reintroduce them in a later phase.</li>
<li>The semantics of the per-block-type block read counts in the performance context now match those of the generic block_read_count.</li>
<li>Errors related to the retrieval of the compression dictionary are now propagated to the user.</li>
<li>db_bench adds a "benchmark" stats_history, which prints out the whole stats history.</li>
<li>Overload GetAllKeyVersions() to support non-default column family.</li>
<li>Added new APIs ExportColumnFamily() and CreateColumnFamilyWithImport() to support export and import of a Column Family. <a href="https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/3469">https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/issues/3469</a></li>
<li>ldb sometimes uses a string-append merge operator if no merge operator is passed in. This is to allow users to print keys from a DB with a merge operator.</li>
<li>Replaces old Registra with ObjectRegistry to allow user to create custom object from string, also add LoadEnv() to Env.</li>
<li>Added new overload of GetApproximateSizes which gets SizeApproximationOptions object and returns a Status. The older overloads are redirecting their calls to this new method and no longer assert if the include_flags doesn't have either of INCLUDE_MEMTABLES or INCLUDE_FILES bits set. It's recommended to use the new method only, as it is more type safe and returns a meaningful status in case of errors.</li>
<li>LDBCommandRunner::RunCommand() to return the status code as an integer, rather than call exit() using the code.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md502"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add argument <code>--secondary_path</code> to ldb to open the database as the secondary instance. This would keep the original DB intact.</li>
<li>Compression dictionary blocks are now prefetched and pinned in the cache (based on the customer's settings) the same way as index and filter blocks.</li>
<li>Added DBOptions::log_readahead_size which specifies the number of bytes to prefetch when reading the log. This is mostly useful for reading a remotely located log, as it can save the number of round-trips. If 0 (default), then the prefetching is disabled.</li>
<li>Added new option in SizeApproximationOptions used with DB::GetApproximateSizes. When approximating the files total size that is used to store a keys range, allow approximation with an error margin of up to total_files_size * files_size_error_margin. This allows to take some shortcuts in files size approximation, resulting in better performance, while guaranteeing the resulting error is within a reasonable margin.</li>
<li>Support loading custom objects in unit tests. In the affected unit tests, RocksDB will create custom Env objects based on environment variable TEST_ENV_URI. Users need to make sure custom object types are properly registered. For example, a static library should expose a <code>RegisterCustomObjects</code> function. By linking the unit test binary with the static library, the unit test can execute this function.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md503"></a>
Performance Improvements</h2>

6.3.0 (2019-06-18)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md511"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Now DB::Close() will return Aborted() error when there is unreleased snapshot. Users can retry after all snapshots are released.</li>
<li>Index blocks are now handled similarly to data blocks with regards to the block cache: instead of storing objects in the cache, only the blocks themselves are cached. In addition, index blocks no longer get evicted from the cache when a table is closed, can now use the compressed block cache (if any), and can be shared among multiple table readers.</li>
<li>Partitions of partitioned indexes no longer affect the read amplification statistics.</li>
<li>Due to the above refactoring, block cache eviction statistics for indexes are temporarily broken. We plan to reintroduce them in a later phase.</li>
<li>options.keep_log_file_num will be enforced strictly all the time. <a class="el" href="classFile.html" title="File object to represent a file in the autotier filesystem.">File</a> names of all log files will be tracked, which may take significantly amount of memory if options.keep_log_file_num is large and either of options.max_log_file_size or options.log_file_time_to_roll is set.</li>
<li>Add initial support for Get/Put with user timestamps. Users can specify timestamps via ReadOptions and WriteOptions when calling DB::Get and DB::Put.</li>
<li>Accessing a partition of a partitioned filter or index through a pinned reference is no longer considered a cache hit.</li>
<li>Add C bindings for secondary instance, i.e. DBImplSecondary.</li>
<li>Rate limited deletion of WALs is only enabled if DBOptions::wal_dir is not set, or explicitly set to db_name passed to DB::Open and DBOptions::db_paths is empty, or same as db_paths[0].path</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md512"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add an option <code>snap_refresh_nanos</code> (default to 0) to periodically refresh the snapshot list in compaction jobs. Assign to 0 to disable the feature.</li>
<li>Add an option <code>unordered_write</code> which trades snapshot guarantees with higher write throughput. When used with WRITE_PREPARED transactions with two_write_queues=true, it offers higher throughput with however no compromise on guarantees.</li>
<li>Allow DBImplSecondary to remove memtables with obsolete data after replaying MANIFEST and WAL.</li>
<li>Add an option <code>failed_move_fall_back_to_copy</code> (default is true) for external SST ingestion. When <code>move_files</code> is true and hard link fails, ingestion falls back to copy if <code>failed_move_fall_back_to_copy</code> is true. Otherwise, ingestion reports an error.</li>
<li>Add command <code>list_file_range_deletes</code> in ldb, which prints out tombstones in SST files.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md513"></a>

<li>Fix a bug in WAL replay of secondary instance by skipping write batches with older sequence numbers than the current last sequence number.</li>
<li>Fix flush's/compaction's merge processing logic which allowed <code>Put</code>s covered by range tombstones to reappear. Note <code>Put</code>s may exist even if the user only ever called <code>Merge()</code> due to an internal conversion during compaction to the bottommost level.</li>
<li>Fix/improve memtable earliest sequence assignment and WAL replay so that WAL entries of unflushed column families will not be skipped after replaying the MANIFEST and increasing db sequence due to another flushed/compacted column family.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md516"></a>
6.2.0 (2019-04-30)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md517"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add an option <code>strict_bytes_per_sync</code> that causes a file-writing thread to block rather than exceed the limit on bytes pending writeback specified by <code>bytes_per_sync</code> or <code>wal_bytes_per_sync</code>.</li>
<li>Improve range scan performance by avoiding per-key upper bound check in BlockBasedTableIterator.</li>
<li>Introduce Periodic Compaction for Level style compaction. Files are re-compacted periodically and put in the same level.</li>
<li>Block-based table index now contains exact highest key in the file, rather than an upper bound. This may improve Get() and iterator Seek() performance in some situations, especially when direct IO is enabled and block cache is disabled. A setting BlockBasedTableOptions::index_shortening is introduced to control this behavior. Set it to kShortenSeparatorsAndSuccessor to get the old behavior.</li>
<li>When reading from option file/string/map, customized envs can be filled according to object registry.</li>
<li>Improve range scan performance when using explicit user readahead by not creating new table readers for every iterator.</li>
<li>Add index type BlockBasedTableOptions::IndexType::kBinarySearchWithFirstKey. It significantly reduces read amplification in some setups, especially for iterator seeks. It's not fully implemented yet: IO errors are not handled right.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md518"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Change the behavior of OptimizeForPointLookup(): move away from hash-based block-based-table index, and use whole key memtable filtering.</li>
<li>Change the behavior of OptimizeForSmallDb(): use a 16MB block cache, put index and filter blocks into it, and cost the memtable size to it. DBOptions.OptimizeForSmallDb() and ColumnFamilyOptions.OptimizeForSmallDb() start to take an optional cache object.</li>
<li>Added BottommostLevelCompaction::kForceOptimized to avoid double compacting newly compacted files in the bottommost level compaction of manual compaction. Note this option may prohibit the manual compaction to produce a single file in the bottommost level.</li>

<li>Enabled checkpoint on readonly db (DBImplReadOnly).</li>
<li>Make DB ignore dropped column families while committing results of atomic flush.</li>
<li>RocksDB may choose to preopen some files even if options.max_open_files != -1. This may make DB open slightly longer.</li>
<li>For users of dictionary compression with ZSTD v0.7.0+, we now reuse the same digested dictionary when compressing each of an SST file's data blocks for faster compression speeds.</li>
<li>For all users of dictionary compression who set <code>cache_index_and_filter_blocks == true</code>, we now store dictionary data used for decompression in the block cache for better control over memory usage. For users of ZSTD v1.1.4+ who compile with -DZSTD_STATIC_LINKING_ONLY, this includes a digested dictionary, which is used to increase decompression speed.</li>
<li>Add support for block checksums verification for external SST files before ingestion.</li>
<li>Introduce stats history which periodically saves Statistics snapshots and added <code>GetStatsHistory</code> API to retrieve these snapshots.</li>
<li>Add a place holder in manifest which indicate a record from future that can be safely ignored.</li>
<li>Add support for trace sampling.</li>
<li>Enable properties block checksum verification for block-based tables.</li>
<li>For all users of dictionary compression, we now generate a separate dictionary for compressing each bottom-level SST file. Previously we reused a single dictionary for a whole compaction to bottom level. The new approach achieves better compression ratios; however, it uses more memory and CPU for buffering/sampling data blocks and training dictionaries.</li>
<li>Add whole key bloom filter support in memtable.</li>
<li>Files written by <code>SstFileWriter</code> will now use dictionary compression if it is configured in the file writer's <code>CompressionOptions</code>.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md530"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Disallow CompactionFilter::IgnoreSnapshots() = false, because it is not very useful and the behavior is confusing. The filter will filter everything if there is no snapshot declared by the time the compaction starts. However, users can define a snapshot after the compaction starts and before it finishes and this new snapshot won't be repeatable, because after the compaction finishes, some keys may be dropped.</li>
<li>CompactionPri = kMinOverlappingRatio also uses compensated file size, which boosts file with lots of tombstones to be compacted first.</li>
<li>Transaction::GetForUpdate is extended with a do_validate parameter with default value of true. If false it skips validating the snapshot before doing the read. Similarly ::Merge, ::Put, ::Delete, and ::SingleDelete are extended with assume_tracked with default value of false. If true it indicates that call is assumed to be after a ::GetForUpdate.</li>
<li><code>TableProperties::num_entries</code> and <code>TableProperties::num_deletions</code> now also account for number of range tombstones.</li>
<li>Remove geodb, spatial_db, document_db, json_document, date_tiered_db, and redis_lists.</li>

5.16.0 (2018-08-21)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md548"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>The merge operands are passed to <code>MergeOperator::ShouldMerge</code> in the reversed order relative to how they were merged (passed to FullMerge or FullMergeV2) for performance reasons</li>
<li>GetAllKeyVersions() to take an extra argument of <code>max_num_ikeys</code>.</li>
<li>Using ZSTD dictionary trainer (i.e., setting <code>CompressionOptions::zstd_max_train_bytes</code> to a nonzero value) now requires ZSTD version 1.1.3 or later.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md549"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changes the format of index blocks by delta encoding the index values, which are the block handles. This saves the encoding of BlockHandle::offset of the non-head index entries in each restart interval. The feature is backward compatible but not forward compatible. It is disabled by default unless format_version 4 or above is used.</li>
<li>Add a new tool: trace_analyzer. Trace_analyzer analyzes the trace file generated by using trace_replay API. It can convert the binary format trace file to a human readable txt file, output the statistics of the analyzed query types such as access statistics and size statistics, combining the dumped whole key space file to analyze, support query correlation analyzing, and etc. Current supported query types are: Get, Put, Delete, SingleDelete, DeleteRange, Merge, Iterator (Seek, SeekForPrev only).</li>
<li>Add hash index support to data blocks, which helps reducing the cpu utilization of point-lookup operations. This feature is backward compatible with the data block created without the hash index. It is disabled by default unless BlockBasedTableOptions::data_block_index_type is set to data_block_index_type = kDataBlockBinaryAndHash.</li>

5.15.0 (2018-07-17)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md552"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Remove managed iterator. ReadOptions.managed is not effective anymore.</li>
<li>For bottommost_compression, a compatible CompressionOptions is added via <code>bottommost_compression_opts</code>. To keep backward compatible, a new boolean <code>enabled</code> is added to CompressionOptions. For compression_opts, it will be always used no matter what value of <code>enabled</code> is. For bottommost_compression_opts, it will only be used when user set <code>enabled=true</code>, otherwise, compression_opts will be used for bottommost_compression as default.</li>
<li>With LRUCache, when high_pri_pool_ratio &gt; 0, midpoint insertion strategy will be enabled to put low-pri items to the tail of low-pri list (the midpoint) when they first inserted into the cache. This is to make cache entries never get hit age out faster, improving cache efficiency when large background scan presents.</li>
<li>For users of <code>Statistics</code> objects created via <code>CreateDBStatistics()</code>, the format of the string returned by its <code>ToString()</code> method has changed.</li>
<li>The "rocksdb.num.entries" table property no longer counts range deletion tombstones as entries.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md553"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Changes the format of index blocks by storing the key in their raw form rather than converting them to InternalKey. This saves 8 bytes per index key. The feature is backward compatible but not forward compatible. It is disabled by default unless format_version 3 or above is used.</li>
<li>Avoid memcpy when reading mmap files with OpenReadOnly and max_open_files==-1.</li>
<li>Support dynamically changing <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::ttl</code> via <code>SetOptions()</code>.</li>
<li>Add a new table property, "rocksdb.num.range-deletions", which counts the number of range deletion tombstones in the table.</li>
<li>Improve the performance of iterators doing long range scans by using readahead, when using direct IO.</li>
<li>pin_top_level_index_and_filter (default true) in BlockBasedTableOptions can be used in combination with cache_index_and_filter_blocks to prefetch and pin the top-level index of partitioned index and filter blocks in cache. It has no impact when cache_index_and_filter_blocks is false.</li>
<li>Write properties meta-block at the end of block-based table to save read-ahead IO.</li>
</ul>

<li>Check conflict at output level in CompactFiles.</li>
<li>Fix corruption in non-iterator reads when mmap is used for file reads</li>
<li>Fix bug with prefix search in partition filters where a shared prefix would be ignored from the later partitions. The bug could report an eixstent key as missing. The bug could be triggered if prefix_extractor is set and partition filters is enabled.</li>
<li>Change default value of <code>bytes_max_delete_chunk</code> to 0 in NewSstFileManager() as it doesn't work well with checkpoints.</li>
<li>Fix a bug caused by not copying the block trailer with compressed SST file, direct IO, prefetcher and no compressed block cache.</li>

5.14.0 (2018-05-16)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md556"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add a BlockBasedTableOption to align uncompressed data blocks on the smaller of block size or page size boundary, to reduce flash reads by avoiding reads spanning 4K pages.</li>
<li>The background thread naming convention changed (on supporting platforms) to "rocksdb:&lt;thread pool priority&gt;&lt;thread number&gt;", e.g., "rocksdb:low0".</li>
<li>Add a new ticker stat rocksdb.number.multiget.keys.found to count number of keys successfully read in MultiGet calls</li>
<li>Touch-up to write-related counters in PerfContext. New counters added: write_scheduling_flushes_compactions_time, write_thread_wait_nanos. Counters whose behavior was fixed or modified: write_memtable_time, write_pre_and_post_process_time, write_delay_time.</li>
<li>Posix Env's NewRandomRWFile() will fail if the file doesn't exist.</li>
<li>Now, <code>DBOptions::use_direct_io_for_flush_and_compaction</code> only applies to background writes, and <code>DBOptions::use_direct_reads</code> applies to both user reads and background reads. This conforms with Linux's <code>open(2)</code> manpage, which advises against simultaneously reading a file in buffered and direct modes, due to possibly undefined behavior and degraded performance.</li>
<li>Iterator::Valid() always returns false if !status().ok(). So, now when doing a Seek() followed by some Next()s, there's no need to check status() after every operation.</li>
<li>Iterator::Seek()/SeekForPrev()/SeekToFirst()/SeekToLast() always resets status().</li>
<li>Introduced <code>CompressionOptions::kDefaultCompressionLevel</code>, which is a generic way to tell RocksDB to use the compression library's default level. It is now the default value for <code>CompressionOptions::level</code>. Previously the level defaulted to -1, which gave poor compression ratios in ZSTD.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md557"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Introduce TTL for level compaction so that all files older than ttl go through the compaction process to get rid of old data.</li>
<li>TransactionDBOptions::write_policy can be configured to enable WritePrepared 2PC transactions. Read more about them in the wiki.</li>
<li>Add DB properties "rocksdb.block-cache-capacity", "rocksdb.block-cache-usage", "rocksdb.block-cache-pinned-usage" to show block cache usage.</li>
<li>Add <code>Env::LowerThreadPoolCPUPriority(Priority)</code> method, which lowers the CPU priority of background (esp. compaction) threads to minimize interference with foreground tasks.</li>
<li>Fsync parent directory after deleting a file in delete scheduler.</li>
<li>In level-based compaction, if bottom-pri thread pool was setup via <code>Env::SetBackgroundThreads()</code>, compactions to the bottom level will be delegated to that thread pool.</li>
<li><code>prefix_extractor</code> has been moved from ImmutableCFOptions to MutableCFOptions, meaning it can be dynamically changed without a DB restart.</li>

<li>Avoid unnecessarily flushing in <code>CompactRange()</code> when the range specified by the user does not overlap unflushed memtables.</li>
<li>If <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::max_subcompactions</code> is set greater than one, we now parallelize large manual level-based compactions.</li>
<li>Add "rocksdb.live-sst-files-size" DB property to return total bytes of all SST files belong to the latest LSM tree.</li>

<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md577"></a>
Public API Change</h2>
<ul>
<li><code>BackupableDBOptions::max_valid_backups_to_open == 0</code> now means no backups will be opened during BackupEngine initialization. Previously this condition disabled limiting backups opened.</li>
<li><code>DBOptions::preserve_deletes</code> is a new option that allows one to specify that DB should not drop tombstones for regular deletes if they have sequence number larger than what was set by the new API call <code>DB::SetPreserveDeletesSequenceNumber(SequenceNumber seqnum)</code>. Disabled by default.</li>
<li>API call <code>DB::SetPreserveDeletesSequenceNumber(SequenceNumber seqnum)</code> was added, users who wish to preserve deletes are expected to periodically call this function to advance the cutoff seqnum (all deletes made before this seqnum can be dropped by DB). It's user responsibility to figure out how to advance the seqnum in the way so the tombstones are kept for the desired period of time, yet are eventually processed in time and don't eat up too much space.</li>
<li><code>ReadOptions::iter_start_seqnum</code> was added; if set to something &gt; 0 user will see 2 changes in iterators behavior 1) only keys written with sequence larger than this parameter would be returned and 2) the <code>Slice</code> returned by iter-&gt;key() now points to the memory that keep User-oriented representation of the internal key, rather than user key. New struct <code>FullKey</code> was added to represent internal keys, along with a new helper function <code>ParseFullKey(const Slice&amp; internal_key, FullKey* result);</code>.</li>
<li>Deprecate trash_dir param in NewSstFileManager, right now we will rename deleted files to &lt;name&gt;.trash instead of moving them to trash directory</li>
<li>Allow setting a custom trash/DB size ratio limit in the SstFileManager, after which files that are to be scheduled for deletion are deleted immediately, regardless of any delete ratelimit.</li>

<li><code>DBOptions::bytes_per_sync</code>, <code>DBOptions::compaction_readahead_size</code>, and <code>DBOptions::wal_bytes_per_sync</code> can now be changed dynamically, <code>DBOptions::wal_bytes_per_sync</code> will flush all memtables and switch to a new WAL file.</li>
<li>Support dynamic adjustment of rate limit according to demand for background I/O. It can be enabled by passing <code>true</code> to the <code>auto_tuned</code> parameter in <code>NewGenericRateLimiter()</code>. The value passed as <code>rate_bytes_per_sec</code> will still be respected as an upper-bound.</li>
<li>Support dynamically changing <code>ColumnFamilyOptions::compaction_options_fifo</code>.</li>
<li>Introduce <code>EventListener::OnStallConditionsChanged()</code> callback. Users can implement it to be notified when user writes are stalled, stopped, or resumed.</li>
<li>Add a new db property "rocksdb.estimate-oldest-key-time" to return oldest data timestamp. The property is available only for FIFO compaction with compaction_options_fifo.allow_compaction = false.</li>
<li>Upon snapshot release, recompact bottommost files containing deleted/overwritten keys that previously could not be dropped due to the snapshot. This alleviates space-amp caused by long-held snapshots.</li>
<li>Support lower bound on iterators specified via <code>ReadOptions::iterate_lower_bound</code>.</li>

<li>Universal compactions including the bottom level can be executed in a dedicated thread pool. This alleviates head-of-line blocking in the compaction queue, which cause write stalling, particularly in multi-instance use cases.

<li>WBWIIterator::Entry() now returns WriteEntry instead of <code>const WriteEntry&amp;</code></li>
<li>options.hard_rate_limit is deprecated.</li>
<li>When options.soft_rate_limit or options.level0_slowdown_writes_trigger is triggered, the way to slow down writes is changed to: write rate to DB is limited to to options.delayed_write_rate.</li>
<li>DB::GetApproximateSizes() adds a parameter to allow the estimation to include data in mem table, with default to be not to include. It is now only supported in skip list mem table.</li>
<li>DB::CompactRange() now accept CompactRangeOptions instead of multiple parameters. CompactRangeOptions is defined in <a class="el" href="options_8h_source.html">include/rocksdb/options.h</a>.</li>
<li>CompactRange() will now skip bottommost level compaction for level based compaction if there is no compaction filter, bottommost_level_compaction is introduced in CompactRangeOptions to control when it's possible to skip bottommost level compaction. This mean that if you want the compaction to produce a single file you need to set bottommost_level_compaction to BottommostLevelCompaction::kForce.</li>
<li>Add Cache.GetPinnedUsage() to get the size of memory occupied by entries that are in use by the system.</li>
<li>DB:Open() will fail if the compression specified in Options is not linked with the binary. If you see this failure, recompile RocksDB with compression libraries present on your system. Also, previously our default compression was snappy. This behavior is now changed. Now, the default compression is snappy only if it's available on the system. If it isn't we change the default to kNoCompression.</li>
<li>We changed how we account for memory used in block cache. Previously, we only counted the sum of block sizes currently present in block cache. Now, we count the actual memory usage of the blocks. For example, a block of size 4.5KB will use 8KB memory with jemalloc. This might decrease your memory usage and possibly decrease performance. Increase block cache size if you see this happening after an upgrade.</li>
<li>Add BackupEngineImpl.options_.max_background_operations to specify the maximum number of operations that may be performed in parallel. Add support for parallelized backup and restore.</li>
<li>Add DB::SyncWAL() that does a WAL sync without blocking writers.</li>
</ul>

3.11.0 (2015-05-19)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md657"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added a new API Cache::SetCapacity(size_t capacity) to dynamically change the maximum configured capacity of the cache. If the new capacity is less than the existing cache usage, the implementation will try to lower the usage by evicting the necessary number of elements following a strict LRU policy.</li>
<li>Added an experimental API for handling flashcache devices (blacklists background threads from caching their reads) &ndash; NewFlashcacheAwareEnv</li>
<li>If universal compaction is used and options.num_levels &gt; 1, compact files are tried to be stored in none-L0 with smaller files based on options.target_file_size_base. The limitation of DB size when using universal compaction is greatly mitigated by using more levels. You can set num_levels = 1 to make universal compaction behave as before. If you set num_levels &gt; 1 and want to roll back to a previous version, you need to compact all files to a big file in level 0 (by setting target_file_size_base to be large and CompactRange(&lt;cf_handle&gt;, nullptr, nullptr, true, 0) and reopen the DB with the same version to rewrite the manifest, and then you can open it using previous releases.</li>
<li>More information about rocksdb background threads are available in Env::GetThreadList(), including the number of bytes read / written by a compaction job, mem-table size and current number of bytes written by a flush job and many more. Check <a class="el" href="thread__status_8h_source.html">include/rocksdb/thread_status.h</a> for more detail.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md658"></a>
Public API changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>TablePropertiesCollector::AddUserKey() is added to replace TablePropertiesCollector::Add(). AddUserKey() exposes key type, sequence number and file size up to now to users.</li>
<li>DBOptions::bytes_per_sync used to apply to both WAL and table files. As of 3.11 it applies only to table files. If you want to use this option to sync WAL in the background, please use wal_bytes_per_sync</li>
</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md659"></a>
3.10.0 (2015-03-24)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md660"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>GetThreadStatus() is now able to report detailed thread status, including:<ul>
<li>Thread Operation including flush and compaction.</li>
<li>The stage of the current thread operation.</li>
<li>The elapsed time in micros since the current thread operation started. More information can be found in <a class="el" href="thread__status_8h_source.html">include/rocksdb/thread_status.h</a>. In addition, when running db_bench with &ndash;thread_status_per_interval, db_bench will also report thread status periodically.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Changed the LRU caching algorithm so that referenced blocks (by iterators) are never evicted. This change made parameter removeScanCountLimit obsolete. Because of that NewLRUCache doesn't take three arguments anymore. table_cache_remove_scan_limit option is also removed</li>
<li>By default we now optimize the compilation for the compilation platform (using -march=native). If you want to build portable binary, use 'PORTABLE=1' before the make command.</li>
<li>We now allow level-compaction to place files in different paths by specifying them in db_paths along with the target_size. Lower numbered levels will be placed earlier in the db_paths and higher numbered levels will be placed later in the db_paths vector.</li>
<li>Potentially big performance improvements if you're using RocksDB with lots of column families (100-1000)</li>
<li>Added BlockBasedTableOptions.format_version option, which allows user to specify which version of block based table he wants. As a general guideline, newer versions have more features, but might not be readable by older versions of RocksDB.</li>
<li>Added new block based table format (version 2), which you can enable by setting BlockBasedTableOptions.format_version = 2. This format changes how we encode size information in compressed blocks and should help with memory allocations if you're using Zlib or BZip2 compressions.</li>
<li>MemEnv (env that stores data in memory) is now available in default library build. You can create it by calling NewMemEnv().</li>
<li>Add SliceTransform.SameResultWhenAppended() to help users determine it is safe to apply prefix bloom/hash.</li>
<li>Block based table now makes use of prefix bloom filter if it is a full fulter.</li>
<li>Block based table remembers whether a whole key or prefix based bloom filter is supported in SST files. Do a sanity check when reading the file with users' configuration.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug in ReadOnlyBackupEngine that deleted corrupted backups in some cases, even though the engine was ReadOnly</li>
<li>options.level_compaction_dynamic_level_bytes, a feature to allow RocksDB to pick dynamic base of bytes for levels. With this feature turned on, we will automatically adjust max bytes for each level. The goal of this feature is to have lower bound on size amplification. For more details, see comments in <a class="el" href="options_8h_source.html">options.h</a>.</li>
<li>Added an abstract base class WriteBatchBase for write batches</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where we start deleting files of a dropped column families even if there are still live references to it</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md661"></a>

3.6.0 (2014-10-07)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md674"></a>
Disk format changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>If you're using RocksDB on ARM platforms and you're using default bloom filter, there is a disk format change you need to be aware of. There are three steps you need to do when you convert to new release: 1. turn off filter policy, 2. compact the whole database, 3. turn on filter policy</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md675"></a>
Behavior changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>We have refactored our system of stalling writes. Any stall-related statistics' meanings are changed. Instead of per-write stall counts, we now count stalls per-epoch, where epochs are periods between flushes and compactions. You'll find more information in our Tuning Perf Guide once we release RocksDB 3.6.</li>
<li>When disableDataSync=true, we no longer sync the MANIFEST file.</li>
<li>Add identity_as_first_hash property to CuckooTable. SST file needs to be rebuilt to be opened by reader properly.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md676"></a>
Public API changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>Change target_file_size_base type to uint64_t from int.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md677"></a>
3.5.0 (2014-09-03)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md678"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Add include/utilities/write_batch_with_index.h, providing a utility class to query data out of WriteBatch when building it.</li>
<li>Move BlockBasedTable related options to BlockBasedTableOptions from Options. Change corresponding JNI interface. Options affected include: no_block_cache, block_cache, block_cache_compressed, block_size, block_size_deviation, block_restart_interval, filter_policy, whole_key_filtering. filter_policy is changed to shared_ptr from a raw pointer.</li>
<li>Remove deprecated options: disable_seek_compaction and db_stats_log_interval</li>
<li>OptimizeForPointLookup() takes one parameter for block cache size. It now builds hash index, bloom filter, and block cache.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md680"></a>
3.4.0 (2014-08-18)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md681"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Support Multiple DB paths in universal style compactions</li>
<li>Add feature of storing plain table index and bloom filter in SST file.</li>
<li>CompactRange() will never output compacted files to level 0. This used to be the case when all the compaction input files were at level 0.</li>
<li>Added iterate_upper_bound to define the extent upto which the forward iterator will return entries. This will prevent iterating over delete markers and overwritten entries for edge cases where you want to break out the iterator anyways. This may improve performance in case there are a large number of delete markers or overwritten entries.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md682"></a>
Public API changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>DBOptions.db_paths now is a vector of a DBPath structure which indicates both of path and target size</li>
<li>NewPlainTableFactory instead of bunch of parameters now accepts PlainTableOptions, which is defined in <a class="el" href="table_8h_source.html">include/rocksdb/table.h</a></li>
<li>Moved include/utilities/*.h to include/rocksdb/utilities/*.h</li>
<li>Statistics APIs now take uint32_t as type instead of Tickers. Also make two access functions getTickerCount and histogramData const</li>
<li>Add DB property rocksdb.estimate-num-keys, estimated number of live keys in DB.</li>
<li>Add DB::GetIntProperty(), which returns DB properties that are integer as uint64_t.</li>
<li>The Prefix Extractor used with V2 compaction filters is now passed user key to SliceTransform::Transform instead of unparsed RocksDB key.</li>

<h1><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md683"></a>
3.3.0 (2014-07-10)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md684"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Added JSON API prototype.</li>
<li>HashLinklist reduces performance outlier caused by skewed bucket by switching data in the bucket from linked list to skip list. Add parameter threshold_use_skiplist in NewHashLinkListRepFactory().</li>
<li>RocksDB is now able to reclaim storage space more effectively during the compaction process. This is done by compensating the size of each deletion entry by the 2X average value size, which makes compaction to be triggered by deletion entries more easily.</li>
<li>Add TimeOut API to write. Now WriteOptions have a variable called timeout_hint_us. With timeout_hint_us set to non-zero, any write associated with this timeout_hint_us may be aborted when it runs longer than the specified timeout_hint_us, and it is guaranteed that any write completes earlier than the specified time-out will not be aborted due to the time-out condition.</li>
<li>Add a rate_limiter option, which controls total throughput of flush and compaction. The throughput is specified in bytes/sec. Flush always has precedence over compaction when available bandwidth is constrained.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md685"></a>

3.2.0 (2014-06-20)</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md687"></a>
Public API changes</h2>
<ul>
<li>We removed seek compaction as a concept from RocksDB because: 1) It makes more sense for spinning disk workloads, while RocksDB is primarily designed for flash and memory, 2) It added some complexity to the important code-paths, 3) None of our internal customers were really using it. Because of that, Options::disable_seek_compaction is now obsolete. It is still a parameter in Options, so it does not break the build, but it does not have any effect. We plan to completely remove it at some point, so we ask users to please remove this option from your code base.</li>
<li>Add two parameters to NewHashLinkListRepFactory() for logging on too many entries in a hash bucket when flushing.</li>
<li>Added new option BlockBasedTableOptions::hash_index_allow_collision. When enabled, prefix hash index for block-based table will not store prefix and allow hash collision, reducing memory consumption.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md688"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>PlainTable now supports a new key encoding: for keys of the same prefix, the prefix is only written once. It can be enabled through encoding_type parameter of NewPlainTableFactory()</li>
<li>Add AdaptiveTableFactory, which is used to convert from a DB of PlainTable to BlockBasedTabe, or vise versa. It can be created using NewAdaptiveTableFactory()</li>
</ul>

<li>Removed BackupEngine::DeleteBackupsNewerThan() function</li>
<li>Added new option &ndash; verify_checksums_in_compaction</li>
<li>Changed Options.prefix_extractor from raw pointer to shared_ptr (take ownership) Changed HashSkipListRepFactory and HashLinkListRepFactory constructor to not take SliceTransform object (use Options.prefix_extractor implicitly)</li>
<li>Added Env::GetThreadPoolQueueLen(), which returns the waiting queue length of thread pools</li>
<li>Added a command "checkconsistency" in ldb tool, which checks if file system state matches DB state (file existence and file sizes)</li>
<li>Separate options related to block based table to a new struct BlockBasedTableOptions.</li>
<li>WriteBatch has a new function Count() to return total size in the batch, and Data() now returns a reference instead of a copy</li>
<li>Add more counters to perf context.</li>
<li>Supports several more DB properties: compaction-pending, background-errors and cur-size-active-mem-table.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="autotoc_md697"></a>
New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>If we find one truncated record at the end of the MANIFEST or WAL files, we will ignore it. We assume that writers of these records were interrupted and that we can safely ignore it.</li>
<li>A new SST format "PlainTable" is added, which is optimized for memory-only workloads. It can be created through NewPlainTableFactory() or NewTotalOrderPlainTableFactory().</li>
<li>A new mem table implementation hash linked list optimizing for the case that there are only few keys for each prefix, which can be created through NewHashLinkListRepFactory().</li>
<li>Merge operator supports a new function PartialMergeMulti() to allow users to do partial merges against multiple operands.</li>
<li>Now compaction filter has a V2 interface. It buffers the kv-pairs sharing the same key prefix, process them in batches, and return the batched results back to DB. The new interface uses a new structure CompactionFilterContext for the same purpose as CompactionFilter::Context in V1.</li>
<li>Geo-spatial support for locations and radial-search.</li>

<li>Huge benchmark performance improvements by multiple efforts. For example, increase in readonly QPS from about 530k in 2.6 release to 1.1 million in 2.7 [1]</li>
<li>Speeding up a way RocksDB deleted obsolete files - no longer listing the whole directory under a lock &ndash; decrease in p99</li>
